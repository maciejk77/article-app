Novel insights are gained in this work, since the generation, transmission and demand models have high geographic resolution, down to scale of individual units, with hourly temporal resolution. It is shown that the increases in the partload efficiency that optimize gas power plants\u2019 financial performance in 2030 are highly dependent on the variability in power production of renewable power plants that are in close proximity to the gas power plants. While coal power plants are also cycled more, an increased baseload efficiency is more beneficial for their financial viability. Thus, there is a need for OEMs to offer a wide range of technology solutions to cover all customers\u2019 needs in electricity markets with high penetrations of renewables. Therefore there is an increased investment risk for OEMs as they strive to match their customers\u2019 future needs.<\/p>\n<\/div>",

The transition of the energy sector towards increased penetrations of renewable power will pose major challenges and opportunities for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and utilities. Since renewable power cannot be dispatched, conventional power plants will face more cycling operation to accommodate variability in renewable production. At the same time, reduced wholesale electricity prices associated with the increased penetration of renewables necessitates lower marginal costs and therefore higher baseload and partload efficiencies of conventional power plants. Thus it is crucial for OEMs and utilities to quantify the financial benefits of new technologies and retrofit upgrades that enhance either flexibility or efficiency of the engines.<\/p>\n<p id=\"idm140695703483232\">Several studies have investigated the impacts of increased renewable penetrations on operation and financial performance of conventional power plants (<a href=\"#fn05\" id=\"xref05\">ESB National Grid, 2004<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"xref21\">Traber and Kemfert, 2011<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"xref18\">Nikolova et al., 2013<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"xref23\">Van den Bergh et al., 2013<\/a>). A common limitation among all these prior studies is the aggregation of the power system to the level of countries or regions, assuming a lossless \u201ccopper plate\u201d transmission system within the aggregated regions. However the performance of an individual power plant is significantly influenced by the topology and sufficiency of the adjacent transmission system, as well as by the presence of renewable installations like wind farms or solar arrays nearby. Hence, a more detailed power systems simulation model, which resolves the individual power plants within the power system, is required to reliably and quantitatively assess the impact of increased renewable penetration on the operation of individual conventional power plants. Therefore within this work, a novel power systems simulation framework, which simulates the operation of actual power plants within the transmission system, is applied. The goal of this work is to assess the impacts of increased baseload and partload efficiencies on cycling operation and financial performance of individual conventional power plants in central Europe in 2030.<\/p>\n<div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm140695701105728\"><\/a> <!-- named anchor -->\n<h4 class=\"section-title\">Methodology<\/h4>\n<p id=\"idm140695701113472\">Our in-house power systems simulation framework EnerPol (<a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"xref19\">Singh et al., 2013<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn06\" id=\"xref06\">Eser et al., 2015<\/a>) is applied in this work. Within EnerPol, a detailed geo-referenced representation of the central European power systems is the basis of hourly, chronological AC optimal power flow simulations. The generation model comprises 5,000 individual power plants, distinguishing between conventional and renewable power plants. Detailed thermodynamic models are applied to incorporate conventional power plants\u2019 baseload and cycling operation, as well as costs and constraints of ramping (<a href=\"#fn07\" id=\"xref07\">Eser et al., 2016a<\/a>). The exact geographic locations of the power plants are used in the model, as shown in <a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1<\/a>. The hourly energy production of solar and wind power plants is derived from in-house meso-scale weather simulations. The transmission system model consists of 3,000 high voltage transmission lines and 2,000 substations, as shown in <a href=\"#F2\">Figure 2<\/a>. The hourly cross-border power flows to the non-simulated neighboring countries are derived from ENTSO-E statistics (<a href=\"#fn04\" id=\"xref04\">ENTSO-E, 2015<\/a>) and are distributed across the tielines proportionally to the tielines\u2019 capacity ratings. The hourly end-user electricity demand is differentiated by the consumer groups of households, industry, commerce and transportation and is spatially allocated with respect to each consumer group\u2019s density distribution. The resulting hourly electricity demand is aggregated to the nearest substation. More information about the applied simulation framework is given by the present authors in (<a href=\"#fn07\" id=\"xref07\">Eser et al., 2016a<\/a>).<\/p>\n<div class=\"container-fluid img-container\">\n<div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F1\"><\/a>\n<div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/0d9b7735-2e24-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/rem_illo_facilis_400.png\" \/><\/div>\n<div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/0d9b7735-2e24-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/rem_illo_facilis_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"><\/i><\/span> Enlarge Image <\/a><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/0d9b7735-2e24-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JGPPS-00014-2017-01_F0001.tif\" download=\"JGPPS-00014-2017-01_F0001.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"><\/i><\/span> Download Image <\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 1 - Power plant model of the central European power system used in this work.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"container-fluid img-container\">\n<div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F2\"><\/a>\n<div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/0d9b7735-2e24-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/vel_suscipit_omnis_400.png\" \/><\/div>\n<div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/0d9b7735-2e24-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/vel_suscipit_omnis_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"><\/i><\/span> Enlarge Image <\/a><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/0d9b7735-2e24-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JGPPS-00014-2017-01_F0002.tif\" download=\"JGPPS-00014-2017-01_F0002.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"><\/i><\/span> Download Image <\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 2 - High voltage transmission system model of the central European power system that is used in this work.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm140695703563120\"><\/a> <!-- named anchor -->\n<h4 class=\"section-title\">Improved partload and baseload efficiencies for selected power plants<\/h4>\n<p id=\"idm140695704717168\">To investigate the impacts of increased partload and baseload efficiencies on the operational and financial performance of conventional power plants, a set of 45 coal and natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plants, whose characteristics are summarized in <a href=\"#T1\"><span class=\"generated\">Table 1<\/span><\/a> and whose locations are shown in <a href=\"#F3\">Figure 3<\/a>, are considered to be upgraded in 2030.

An increase in either partload or baseload efficiency reduces a plant\u2019s marginal cost of power production; hence the power plant is dispatched more frequently as its marginal cost is lower on the merit order curve. While an increase in baseload efficiency results in the power plant being dispatched more in baseload, an increase in partload efficiency enables the power plant to gain market shares during periods of low prices, whereas without the increase of the partload efficiency, it would not have been profitable to dispatch the power plant. This simulation framework therefore represents an operational response to increased efficiency, which realistically simulates power plants\u2019 operation in the real wholesale market.<\/p>\n<p id=\"idm140695701061136\">For each of the upgraded 45 power plants, the efficiency curves are adapted to reflect the assumed increase in partload or baseload efficiency, as shown in <a href=\"#F4\">Figure 4<\/a>. To enable an assessment of the impacts of different extents of efficiency improvements, the baseload and partload efficiencies are increased by 1%, 2% and 3%. The efficiency curves for the baseload efficiency increase scenarios are adapted only in the 100% load point, to enable a clear distinction in simulation results between partload and baseload efficiency increases.<\/p>\n<div class=\"container-fluid img-container\">\n<div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F4\"><\/a>\n<div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/0d9b7735-2e24-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/cumque_amet_accusamus_400.png\" \/><\/div>\n<div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/0d9b7735-2e24-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/cumque_amet_accusamus_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"><\/i><\/span> Enlarge Image <\/a><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/0d9b7735-2e24-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JGPPS-00014-2017-01_F0004.tif\" download=\"JGPPS-00014-2017-01_F0004.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"><\/i><\/span> Download Image <\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 4 - Illustration of change in efficiency curves for representative coal power plant.

The market share of nuclear power is significantly reduced (34% to 24%) due to the nuclear phase-outs in Germany and Switzerland by 2030.<\/p>\n<div class=\"container-fluid img-container\">\n<div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F5\"><\/a>\n<div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/0d9b7735-2e24-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/delectus_aspernatur_ea_400.png\" \/><\/div>\n<div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/0d9b7735-2e24-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/delectus_aspernatur_ea_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"><\/i><\/span> Enlarge Image <\/a><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/0d9b7735-2e24-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JGPPS-00014-2017-01_F0005.tif\" download=\"JGPPS-00014-2017-01_F0005.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"><\/i><\/span> Download Image <\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 5 - (a) Market shares of power generation technologies in 2013.

This is at the upper end of today\u2019s price ranges, which historic data shows to be in the order of 0.27\u00a0million \u20ac\/MW for coal (<a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"xref11\">GKM, 2015<\/a>), and 0.24 to 0.34\u00a0million \u20ac\/MW (<a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"xref20\">Stadt Hamm, 2015<\/a>) for NGCC, since price increases are assumed for coal, gas and CO<sub>2<\/sub> emissions certificates, which increase the electricity price across the European power system. It can be seen, that the selected NGCC power plants achieve on average higher capacity-specific revenues than the selected coal power plants. This is because the coal price is assumed to increase more (+26%) than the gas price (+14%) until 2030, and because the increase in CO<sub>2<\/sub> prices shifts market shares from coal towards NGCC plants, as the capacity factors in <a href=\"#T4\"><span class=\"generated\">Table 4<\/span><\/a> also indicate. Furthermore, as can be seen from <a href=\"#T5\"><span class=\"generated\">Table 5<\/span><\/a> , there is a fundamental difference in operational requirements between coal and NGCC power plants in 2030: While the upgraded coal power plants profit significantly from increased baseload efficiencies (0.27 to 0.41\u00a0m\u20ac\/MW), there is only a small increase in revenues for coal plants from increased partload efficiency (0.27 to 0.29\u00a0m\u20ac\/MW).

This is mainly because coal power plants, which had only achieved intermittent load capacity factors in the range of 0.2 to 0.4 in the 2030 reference scenario, now have more opportunity to run in baseload, which increases their revenue. The few coal power plants, which have not achieved any significant market penetration in the reference scenario (capacity factor below 0.15), do not profit from increasing baseload efficiencies, as they are not cost effective enough to penetrate the market at all, independent of any efficiency increase. <a href=\"#F6\">Figure 6b<\/a> shows that there is consistently little impact of increased partload efficiency on coal power plant revenue. This is because the partload efficiency increase slightly increases the profitability during partload operation, yet does not enable the plants that run in intermittent operation to move towards more baseload operation.<\/p>\n<p id=\"idm140695701019856\"><a href=\"#F7\">Figures 7a<\/a> and <a href=\"#F7\">7b<\/a> show an opposite effect for NGCC plants compared to coal plants (<a href=\"#F6\">Figure 6b<\/a>). There is only a moderate increase of revenues for NGCC plants with increasing baseload efficiencies (<a href=\"#F7\">Figure 7a<\/a>); the main increase is seen for NGCC plants that ran in a capacity factor range of 0.2 to 0.4 in the reference scenario. However with increasing partload efficiency (<a href=\"#F7\">Figure 7b<\/a>), it can be seen that there is a significant increase in revenue for several NGCC plants, while many other plants are not affected at all. Since this discrepancy cannot be explained only in terms of the operating regime of the NGCC plants, it is interesting to assess the role of the power plants\u2019 geographic location in this trend.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm140695701115376\"><\/a> <!-- named anchor -->\n<h4 class=\"section-title\">Impact of instalment location of NGCC power plants on revenue increase<\/h4>\n<p id=\"idm140695701114608\">The results of <a href=\"#F7\">Figure 7<\/a> are disaggregated to the country level in <a href=\"#T6\"><span class=\"generated\">Table 6<\/span><\/a> . It can be seen that NGCC power plants in Germany benefit most from increasing baseload efficiency (+29% revenue increase), while the highest increase in revenue from a partload efficiency increase is seen for NGCC power plants in Italy (+37%). This effect is explained in more detail in <a href=\"#F8\">Figures 8<\/a> and <a href=\"#F9\">9<\/a>. <a href=\"#F8\">Figure 8<\/a> shows the average weekly fluctuation of power production for the upgraded NGCC power plants in Germany and Italy in the reference scenario for 2030. <a href=\"#F9\">Figure 9<\/a> shows the relative fluctuation of combined wind and solar power production for an average week in Germany and Italy. It is evident that the NGCC power plants in Italy have to adjust to market fluctuations more frequently and more heavily than the NGCC power plants in Germany (<a href=\"#F8\">Figure 8<\/a>). This is because there is a higher relative fluctuation of renewable power production in Italy compared to Germany (<a href=\"#F9\">Figure 9<\/a>). The direct influence of renewables on the operation of NGCC can be seen most clearly during noon hours, where NGCC in Italy have to reduce their power production to accommodate the peaks in solar power production. The relative fluctuation of renewables is lower in Germany than in Italy because in Germany, the share of renewables is split evenly between wind and solar (see <a href=\"#T2\"><span class=\"generated\">Table 2<\/span><\/a> ) whereas in Italy, there is three times more solar power than wind power. Since the power production of wind power plants varies less than for solar power plants, the overall renewable power production is less variable in Germany than in Italy, as <a href=\"#F9\">Figure 9<\/a> shows. The standard deviations of relative power production are 0.42 for Germany and 0.82 for Italy. Consequently, the standard deviation of relative weekly power production by NGCC power plants is 0.14 in Germany, and 0.19 in Italy. Therefore, the increased variability of renewable power production requires NGCC in Italy to cycle more, which leads to a higher benefit of increased partload efficiencies compared to NGCC in Germany, as seen in <a href=\"#T6\"><span class=\"generated\">Table 6<\/span><\/a> .<\/p>\n<div class=\"container-fluid table-container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"col-sm-8\">\n<div class=\"img-table-footer row\">\n<p class=\"fig-title\">Table 6 - Impact of efficiency increases on relative increase in capacity-specific revenue compared to 2030 reference scenario for NGCC power plants in France, Italy and Germany.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n<div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-right\"><a href=\"#T6\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"><\/i><\/span>Enlarge Table <\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"row inline-content\" id=\"article-table\">\n<div class=\"table-overflow\">\n<table class=\"table table-hover\" id=\"T6\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Baseload efficiency increase<\/th>\n<th align=\"center\">1%<\/th>\n<th align=\"center\">2%<\/th>\n<th align=\"center\">3%<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">France<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\">+4%<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\">+6%<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\">+9%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Italy<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\">0%<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\">+2%<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\">+10%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Germany<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\">+3%<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\">+13%<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\">+29%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"border-top: 1px solid #0075c9;\" align=\"left\"><b>Partload efficiency increase<\/b><\/th>\n<th style=\"border-top: 1px solid #0075c9;\" align=\"center\"><b>1%<\/b><\/th>\n<th style=\"border-top: 1px solid #0075c9;\" align=\"center\"><b>2%<\/b><\/th>\n<th style=\"border-top: 1px solid #0075c9;\" align=\"center\"><b>3%<\/b><\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">France<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\">+2%<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\">+4%<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\">+5%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Italy<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\">+11%<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\">+25%<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\">+37%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">Germany<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\">+4%<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\">+10%<\/td>\n<td align=\"center\">+16%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"container-fluid img-container\">\n<div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F8\"><\/a>\n<div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/0d9b7735-2e24-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/aliquid_ut_quis_400.png\" \/><\/div>\n<div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/0d9b7735-2e24-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/aliquid_ut_quis_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"><\/i><\/span> Enlarge Image <\/a><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/0d9b7735-2e24-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JGPPS-00014-2017-01_F0008.tif\" download=\"JGPPS-00014-2017-01_F0008.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"><\/i><\/span> Download Image <\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 8 - Relative weekly power production of NGCC power plants in Germany and Italy, for 2030 reference scenario.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"container-fluid img-container\">\n<div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F9\"><\/a>\n<div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/0d9b7735-2e24-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/neque_iste_ut_400.png\" \/><\/div>\n<div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/0d9b7735-2e24-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/neque_iste_ut_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"><\/i><\/span> Enlarge Image <\/a><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/0d9b7735-2e24-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JGPPS-00014-2017-01_F0009.tif\" download=\"JGPPS-00014-2017-01_F0009.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"><\/i><\/span> Download Image <\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 9 - Relative weekly power production of renewable capacities in Germany and Italy, for 2030 reference scenario.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p id=\"idm140695703501584\">In <a href=\"#F10\">Figure 10<\/a>, the annual average locational marginal electricity prices (LMPs), in blue coloured contours, and the relative increase in revenue for the 3% partload efficiency increase case of all upgraded NGCC power plants, red coloured symbols, are shown. The plotted average LMP values are calculated as averages of the hourly LMPs at each substation throughout the year; values for locations between two substations are interpolated accordingly. It is clear that the NGCC power plants most positively affected by the partload efficiency increase are located in northern Italy, which coincides with the locations with the highest electricity prices. This is because in the high-price region of northern Italy, NGCC power plants have to cover most of the load, which includes frequent ramps to adjust to the fluctuations in demand and solar power production. Since the NGCC power plants in northern Italy encounter more ramps and more partload operation than NGCC power plants in other regions of Europe, NGCC power plants in Italy benefit most from a partload efficiency increase.<\/p>\n<div class=\"container-fluid img-container\">\n<div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F10\"><\/a>\n<div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/0d9b7735-2e24-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/dolor_quis_harum_400.png\" \/><\/div>\n<div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/0d9b7735-2e24-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/dolor_quis_harum_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"><\/i><\/span> Enlarge Image <\/a><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/0d9b7735-2e24-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JGPPS-00014-2017-01_F0010.tif\" download=\"JGPPS-00014-2017-01_F0010.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"><\/i><\/span> Download Image <\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 10 - Annual average LMP [\u20ac\/MWh] and increase in revenue [%] for all upgraded NGCC power plants in 3% partload efficiency increase scenario.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm140695701059232\"><\/a> <!-- named anchor -->\n<h4 class=\"section-title\">Financial comparison of revenue effects and cycling effects<\/h4>\n<p id=\"idm140695701058464\">As seen in <a href=\"#T4\"><span class=\"generated\">Table 4<\/span><\/a> , the conventional power plants will not only encounter new revenue opportunities in 2030, but also significantly increased numbers of starts and ramps to accommodate the increased penetration of non-dispatchable renewables in the central European power system. The relative change in annual cycling cost compared to the 2030 reference scenario is shown in <a href=\"#F11\">Figure 11<\/a> together with the relative change in revenue for each efficiency increase scenario. It is evident that for the most beneficial efficiency improvements (baseload for coal power plants and partload for NGCC power plants), the revenue increase outweighs the increase in cycling cost, yielding an overall positive balance. Only for the case of an increase in baseload efficiency of NGCC power plants is the increase in cycling cost higher than the increase in revenue; this is due to a significant increase in load-following ramps of the corresponding NGCC plants. This underlines again, that for NGCC power plants an increase in partload efficiencies is more beneficial than an increase in baseload efficiency.<\/p>\n<div class=\"container-fluid img-container\">\n<div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F11\"><\/a>\n<div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/0d9b7735-2e24-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/sit_similique_qui_400.png\" \/><\/div>\n<div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/0d9b7735-2e24-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/sit_similique_qui_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"><\/i><\/span> Enlarge Image <\/a><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/0d9b7735-2e24-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JGPPS-00014-2017-01_F0011.tif\" download=\"JGPPS-00014-2017-01_F0011.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"><\/i><\/span> Download Image <\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 11 - Relative increase in annual revenue and cycling costs for coal (<i>top<\/i>) and NGCC (<i>bottom<\/i>) power plants for all baseload and partload efficiency increase scenarios.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm140695701072864\"><\/a> <!-- named anchor -->\n<h3 class=\"main-title\">Conclusions<\/h3>\n<p id=\"idm140695701070992\">Our in-house bottom up power systems simulation framework EnerPol is applied in this work to assess the impact of increased baseload and partload efficiencies on operational and financial performances of coal and NGCC power plants in the central European power system of 2030. Within this simulation framework, all conventional power plants are being simulated individually, which enables unique insights into the effects of improved efficiencies on power plant operation.<\/p>\n<p id=\"idm140695701070048\">The simulations show that compared to 2013, cycling operation is significantly increased for both coal and NGCC power plants in 2030. This is due to the significant increase in penetration of fluctuating renewables such as wind and solar. Additionally, the investigated coal power plants are found to lose 50% capacity factor because of assumed increases in coal prices and CO<sub>2<\/sub> emissions costs, which indicates a financially critical situation for coal power plants in central Europe by 2030. The increase of baseload and partload efficiencies is shown to have varying effects for coal and NGCC power plants. While the investigated coal power plants benefit heavily from increased baseload efficiency (+57% revenue for 3% baseload efficiency increase scenario), the NGCC power plants are found to benefit more from increased partload efficiencies (+21% revenue for 3% partload efficiency increase). This is due to the different roles of coal and NGCC power plants in the high-renewable European power system of 2030: While both coal and NGCC power plants face more cycling operation to adjust to the fluctuating renewables, coal power plants are operated more in baseload operation whenever profitable. NGCC power plants however, especially those in northern Italy, face more partload operation, since being the major source of operational flexibility to balance the increasing penetration of solar power in Italy. The relative increase in cycling cost is found to be below the relative increase in revenue for all cases except small baseload efficiency increases of NGCC power plants, which underlines the financial viability of the investigated efficiency increases.<\/p>\n<p id=\"idm140695701090224\">The results in this work show that conventional power plants still have a market in 2030, despite significantly increased penetration of renewables and increased prices of fuel and CO<sub>2<\/sub> certificates. In general, the market is found to favour investments in new NGCC capacities over new coal capacities, due to the NGCC\u2019s improved operational flexibility and reduced CO<sub>2<\/sub> intensity. But this work also highlights the necessity for OEMs and utilities to prepare for new challenges in high-renewable energy systems. Compared to today, both coal and NGCC power plants will face significantly increased cycling operation, which causes the need for more resilient power plant components and adjusted maintenance intervals. With increasing renewable penetration, the volume of the ancillary services market will increase, which will favour technical solutions that reduce the incurred costs and damages of frequent load cycles. This will require improved control and reduction of thermal gradients in the engine. Component designs like stack dampers reduce heat losses in CCGT HRSGs after shut-down and therefore shift the starting regime from cold to less damaging warm and hot starts. Improved thermal stress controllers enable more aggressive ramping of gas and steam turbines while maintaining all damage-relevant stress levels.<\/p>\n<p id=\"idm140695695583648\">Utilities will seek to maintain or increase their market shares in the increasingly competitive electricity market. Baseload and partload efficiency increases are shown to be very effective measures to improve existing and future coal and NGCC power plants\u2019 financial performance. For coal power plants, retrofit upgrades increasing the baseload efficiency, such as flue gas heat recovery systems or coal drying systems, yield the most beneficial financial performances. For NGCC power plants, partload efficiency increasing technologies, such as variable-pitch inlet guide vanes and inlet air preheating systems, deliver the best financial results. Notwithstanding this general trend, this work also shows that utility preferences can differ widely depending on the market the power plant is intended for \u2014 while NGCC power plants in Italy profit heavily from partload efficiency increases, gas power plants in Germany profit most from improvements in baseload efficiencies. This discrepancy is driven by the variability in power production of each country\u2019s renewable energy portfolio. Since all central European countries have different renewable action plans based on domestic policies and abundance of renewable resources, OEMs will need to offer a wider and more modular range of technical solutions to meet the needs of all customers across central Europe. This diversification of customer needs implies increased investment risk for the OEMs, as more technical solutions will be developed for a smaller group of target customers for each individual solution. In consequence, OEMs will have to increase the capital requirements presented to customers in order to compensate for the additional risks.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"article-back\" class=\"back\">\n<div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm140695701150064\"><\/a> <!-- named anchor -->\n<h3 class=\"main-title\">Competing interests<\/h3>\n<p id=\"idm140695701149072\">Patrick Eser declares that he has no conflict of interest.

      "metaDescription": "The operation of conventional power plants in the 2030 high-renewable energy system of central Europe with high penetration of renewables is simulated in this work. Novel insights are gained in this work, since the generation, transmission and demand models have high geographic resolution, down to scale of individual units, with hourly temporal resolution. It is shown that the increases in the partload efficiency that optimize gas power plants\u2019 financial performance in 2030 are highly dependent on the variability in power production of renewable power plants that are in close proximity to the gas power plants.

      "metaOgDescription": "The operation of conventional power plants in the 2030 high-renewable energy system of central Europe with high penetration of renewables is simulated in this work. Novel insights are gained in this work, since the generation, transmission and demand models have high geographic resolution, down to scale of individual units, with hourly temporal resolution. It is shown that the increases in the partload efficiency that optimize gas power plants\u2019 financial performance in 2030 are highly dependent on the variability in power production of renewable power plants that are in close proximity to the gas power plants. While coal power plants are also cycled more, an increased baseload efficiency is more beneficial for their financial viability. Thus, there is a need for OEMs to offer a wide range of technology solutions to cover all customers\u2019 needs in electricity markets with high penetrations of renewables. Therefore there is an increased investment risk for OEMs as they strive to match their customers\u2019 future needs.\n",

Acoustic indices are used in biodiversity assessments, but need to be compared to traditional wildlife methods. This work was conducted in the Santa Rosa National Park between June and November, 2015. We installed recorders and conducted bird point counts in twelve sampling sites. We compared acoustic indices (Acoustic Evenness Index [AEI], Acoustic Diversity Index [ADI], Acoustic Complexity Index [ACI], Bioacoustic Index [BIO], Normalized Difference Soundscape Index [NDSI], Total Entropy [TE], Median Amplitude Envelope [MAE], Number of peaks [NP]) with indices from bird point counts (Bird Abundance, Bird Richness, Bird Diversity and Bird Evenness), and discuss the utility of acoustic indices as indicators for biodiversity monitoring in tropical forests. ADI, ACI, BIO and TE presented a similar temporal pattern peaking between 5 am and 6 am; and an additional peak at 5 pm, except for ACI. These patterns were consistent with the daily biological rhythms. AEI, ACI, BIO and Bird Abundance were related to characteristics of younger forests (lower percentage of canopy cover) but NP, ADI, TE, Bird Diversity and Bird Evenness were related to characteristics of older forests (higher percentage of canopy cover and a lower number of patches). ACI was positively correlated to Bird Abundance and NP was positively correlated to Bird Diversity. ACI reflects biological activity, but not necessarily a more diverse bird community in this study area. This might be an indication of a strong acoustic competition, or several highly dominant bird species in younger forests. Furthermore, acoustic communities in tropical forests commonly include insects (cicadas) and frogs, which might affect resulting acoustic indices. A variety of methods are probably needed to thoroughly assess biodiversity. However, a combination of indices such as ACI and NP might be considered to monitor trends in abundance and diversity of birds in dry forests.<\/p><\/div>\n",

One of the major challenges in conservation ecology and biology, however, is assessment of biodiversity through effective monitoring techniques that span wide spatial and temporal scales (<a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"xref14\">Depraetere et al., 2012<\/a>). These monitoring programs including observing, locating, classifying and counting animals on a site are critical to: a) understand the state and trends of biodiversity, b) identify vulnerable and endangered species, c) assess the impact of human activity on ecosystems, and d) track invasive species and parasites, among others (<a href=\"#fn36\" id=\"xref36\">Lee et al., 2008<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn40\" id=\"xref40\">Marsh and Trenham, 2008<\/a>). However, they have a limited space-time scale and require considerable human and logistical resources.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246207680\">Interpretation of sounds has been traditionally used to monitor vocalizing organisms. Conservation biology research has used recordings of wildlife vocalizations because they are efficient at confirming species presence, especially in environments with reduced visibility, such as tropical forests, aquatic systems and for studying nocturnal species (<a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"xref19\">Farnsworth and Russell, 2007<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn42\" id=\"xref42\">Mennill and Vehrencamp, 2008<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"xref5\">Bardeli et al., 2010<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn44\" id=\"xref44\">Odom and Mennill, 2010<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"xref13\">Cugler et al., 2011<\/a>). The acoustic information contained in these recordings can provide information on the ecology of vocalizing organisms and their habitats, including their diversity and abundance, as well as phenological events such as seasonal arrivals, breeding periods, and reproductive behavior (<a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"xref21\">Gage et al., 2015<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246157296\">Advances in acoustic sensor networks have allowed expansion of collection of acoustic signals in natural areas on a large scale and in an automated way (<a href=\"#fn50\" id=\"xref50\">Porter et al., 2005<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"xref2\">Aide et al., 2013<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn45\" id=\"xref45\">Ospina et al., 2013<\/a>). Through the systematic and synchronous collection of acoustic data in multiple locations, combined with auxiliary data of light, temperature and humidity, a large volume of valuable ecological information has been produced (<a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"xref21\">Gage et al., 2015<\/a>). This promising acoustic tool provides the capacity to extend the spatio-temporal scale of biological sampling and to perform analyses of large volumes of information (<a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"xref4\">Armitage and Ober, 2010<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"xref5\">Bardeli et al., 2010<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"xref11\">Caycedo-Rosales et al., 2013<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246160720\">The acoustic data of an animal community are generally analyzed using three approaches: a) species auditory identification in recordings by an expert, b) species identification using automatic recognition on recordings, and c) development of global acoustic measurements without need for species identification (<a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"xref22\">Gasc et al., 2013a<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn61\" id=\"xref61\">Sueur et al., 2014<\/a>). The auditory identification of vocalizing individuals requires a high level of proficiency and can be performed only by experts (<a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"xref15\">Dickinson et al., 2010<\/a>) or by automated classification processes (<a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"xref1\">Acevedo et al., 2009<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"xref26\">Han et al., 2011<\/a>). Both approaches are difficult to apply due to overlap of vocalizations observed in diverse acoustic communities (<a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"xref22\">Gasc et al., 2013a<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246186992\">Massive acoustic data need to be handled and analyzed with efficient acoustic tools (<a href=\"#fn61\" id=\"xref61\">Sueur et al., 2014<\/a>). Ecological research has traditionally used indices that describe with a single value the ecological complexity at the scale of community or landscape (<a href=\"#fn41\" id=\"xref41\">Mason et al., 2008<\/a>). The requirement for acoustic tools has led to the concomitant development of ecological indices based on acoustic data that can be used for biodiversity assessments, community dynamics research and landscape patterns (<a href=\"#fn61\" id=\"xref61\">Sueur et al., 2014<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246203712\">In spite of the variety of acoustic indices, only a few studies have assessed their efficacy (<a href=\"#fn39\" id=\"xref39\">Mammides et al., 2017<\/a>). Some of them have focused on simulated communities; for example <a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"xref14\">Depraetere et al. (2012)<\/a> reported an increase in the Entropy Index based on recorded frequencies with the number of species, and <a href=\"#fn62\" id=\"xref62\">Sueur et al. (2008b)<\/a> found an inverse correlation between an Index of Dissimilarity based on variations of frequencies collected and the number of species shared between two simulated communities. According to <a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"xref22\">Gasc et al. (2013a)<\/a>, community-wide acoustic diversity indices revealed phylogenetic diversity and functional species diversity in a theoretical study of birds.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246226592\">Other studies have compared acoustic indices with species diversity indices obtained by manually or automatically inspecting field recordings. <a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"xref18\">Farina et al. (2011)<\/a> and <a href=\"#fn47\" id=\"xref47\">Pieretti et al. (2011)<\/a> showed the capacity of the Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI) to describe the complexity of bird soundscapes in northern Italy. <a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"xref14\">Depraetere et al. (2012)<\/a> found the Acoustic Richness index retrieved expected bird richness values in a temperate French forest. Besides, <a href=\"#fn64\" id=\"xref64\">Towsey et al. (2014)<\/a> found that acoustic indices such as temporal entropy (Ht), Spectral Entropy (Hs) and ACI were useful indicators of bioacoustic activity in general, mainly species diversity, in an Australian bush land. Furthermore, <a href=\"#fn40\" id=\"xref40\">Machado et al. (2017)<\/a> found that the Acoustic Diversity Index (ADI) was significantly correlated to the number of bird species in the savannas from Central Brazil.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246247744\">However, validation of acoustic indices exists mostly in temperate ecosystems. Because tropical environments contain higher levels of diversity (<a href=\"#fn54\" id=\"xref54\">Rodrigues et al., 2014<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn48\" id=\"xref48\">Pieretti et al., 2015<\/a>), their validation is essential in tropical environments (<a href=\"#fn64\" id=\"xref64\">Trigg, 2015<\/a>). In addition, studies to date have focused on acoustic and species diversity indices obtained from recordings, but comparison with ecological data taken by traditional wildlife methods is not yet readily available. In southern China, <a href=\"#fn39\" id=\"xref39\">Mammides et al. (2017)<\/a> assessed performance of several acoustic indices by measuring its correlation to bird species richness and diversity estimated using point-count surveys. These authors found that although no index showed a very strong correlation with species richness or diversity, three indices (the acoustic entropy, acoustic diversity and acoustic evenness indices) performed consistently better, showing moderate correlations.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246153248\">According to <a href=\"#fn61\" id=\"xref61\">Sueur et al. (2014)<\/a>, acoustic indices estimating within-group diversity can be divided into three categories, depending on what they measure, either sound energy, level of complexity in terms of time, frequency and\/or amplitude, or the proportion of different components of a soundscape. These authors postulated that \u201ccomplexity indices\u201d are based on the assumption that the acoustic output of a community or a landscape will increase in complexity with the number of singing individuals and species. Consequently, an index that captures the heterogeneity of sounds should then give a proxy of animal acoustic activity. Based on this assumption, the objective of in this article was to compare acoustic indices with indices derived from bird point counts and discuss the utility of acoustic indices as an alternative strategy to monitor biodiversity in tropical forests. We specifically hypothesized that indices measuring acoustic diversity, heterogeneity or complexity should reflect bird diversity assessed by traditional point count surveys. Furthermore, we expected higher acoustic diversity, heterogeneity or complexity, as well as higher bird diversity in older and more preserved forests, which would result in noticeable spatial patterns in the study area. In addition, we expected temporal patterns in acoustic and diversity indices, with biological activity peaks at dawn and dusk.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45129246156768\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Study area<\/h3><p id=\"idm45129246158320\">The study was conducted in the Santa Rosa National Park (SRNP), Guanacaste Conservation Area from Costa Rica (<a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1<\/a>).

In this subregion severity of the climate prevails with prolonged dry periods. It belongs to the Pacific precipitation regime, characterized by the presence of two well-defined periods, <i>i.e.<\/i>, dry and rainy. The annual rainfall regime is denominated drought with a precipitation between 1,100 and 1,500\u00a0mm (<a href=\"#fn57\" id=\"xref57\">Solano and Villalobos, 2001<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246242560\">The region has a dry season of five to seven months, usually from December to mid-May. During the rainy season (mid-May to November) precipitation can vary between 800 and 2,800\u00a0mm with an annual average of 1,500\u00a0mm. An \u201cIndian summer\u201d or dry spell occurs during the rainy season of up to six weeks between July and August (<a href=\"#fn30\" id=\"xref30\">Janzen, 2004<\/a>). The temperature varies between 26 and 36\u00b0C during the day and 18 to 22\u00b0C at night. Strong winds come from the northeast during the first half of the dry season (<a href=\"#fn30\" id=\"xref30\">Janzen, 2004<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246175648\">According to the Holdridge life zone system, SRNP presents Pre-montane Wet Forest and Tropical Dry Forest (<a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"xref8\">Bola\u00f1os et al., 2005<\/a>). Most plant species are deciduous with short, coarse, and slightly dense shafts, as well as a few epiphytes (<a href=\"#fn57\" id=\"xref57\">Solano and Villalobos, 2001<\/a>). The understory is relatively open, especially during the dry season, when most shrubs lose their leaves (<a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"xref25\">Graham et al., 2016<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246207248\">The SRNP dry forest is floristically more diverse compared to the dry tropical forest of other wild protected areas in Central America (<a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"xref24\">Gillespie et al., 2000<\/a>). It includes secondary forest in different regeneration states and mature forest older than 50 years with a canopy of 30\u00a0m of height in sites unaffected by the agriculture. At least 159 woody species have been reported in the SRNP. In addition, it is considered a mosaic since it includes other types of vegetation such as grasslands and dry oak forest communities (<a href=\"#fn31\" id=\"xref31\">Kalacska et al., 2004<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn51\" id=\"xref51\">Powers et al., 2009<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"xref10\">Carvajal-Vanegas and Calvo-Alvarado, 2013<\/a>). Dominant bird species of the dry forest include: <i>Chiroxiphia linearis<\/i>, <i>Pachyramphus aglaiae<\/i>, <i>Thamnophilus doliatus<\/i>, <i>Thryophilus pleurostictus<\/i>, among others. These species are characterized by emitting loud vocalizations and calls at different times of the day (<a href=\"#fn59\" id=\"xref59\">Stiles and Skutch, 2007<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246218096\">Tropical dry forest is a globally threatened ecosystem and is considered a high priority for conservation (<a href=\"#fn43\" id=\"xref43\">Miles et al., 2006<\/a>). In the province of Guanacaste, tropical dry forest restoration processes have been taken place since the 1980s, a as result of multiple socioeconomic factors and conservation policies (<a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"xref9\">Calvo-Alvarado et al., 2009<\/a>). The Guanacaste Conservation Area has contributed to tropical dry forest protection through regeneration of areas historically dedicated to extensive livestock and exposed to burning and cutting processes (<a href=\"#fn29\" id=\"xref29\">Janzen, 2000<\/a>). This study area was chosen because it contains representative samples of the most fragile forests in the country and potentially threatened by the negative impacts of climate change, and therefore requires long-term monitoring programs for their effective conservation.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45129246246800\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Materials and methods<\/h3><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45129246171648\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Characterization of the study area and sampling sites<\/h4><p id=\"idm45129246171040\">We surveyed 12 sampling sites in SRNP between June and November of 2015; this time period corresponded to the wet climatic season (<a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1<\/a>). Each sampling site consisted of a 1,000\u00a0m transect; transects were located 500\u00a0m apart from each other. To characterize the landscape, we used a buffer area of 500\u00a0m around the central location of each sampling site. In this area, the following landscape metrics were calculated using the Patch Analyst extension (<a href=\"#fn53\" id=\"xref53\">Rempel et al., 2012<\/a>) for ArcGIS (<a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"xref17\">ESRI,  2016<\/a>): Shannon Diversity Index (SDI), Number of Patches (NumP), Mean Patch Edge (MPE), Mean Patch Size (MPS) and Mean Perimeter\/Area Ratio (MPAR). In addition, we performed a spatial trend analysis and interpolation procedures with each landscape index using the Geostatistical Analyst extension for ArcGIS (<a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"xref17\">ESRI,  2016<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246184448\">We also sampled the vegetation structure in sampling sites using plots of 20\u00a0m radius. In each plot we counted and measured the Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) of every tree with more than 10\u00a0cm of DBH. With this data we obtained the total number of trees (NTREES) and the total basal area of trees (BASALAREA) for each plot. In addition, all shrubs with less than 10\u00a0cm of DBH were counted in a 5\u00a0m radius subplot (UNDERSTORY). We finally estimated the canopy cover in four points at each plot with a forest densiometer and the average value for each plot was obtained (CANOPY).<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45129246196592\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Characterization of soundscapes and bird communities<\/h4><p id=\"idm45129246195984\">On each of the 12 sampling sites, we installed five Song Meter Digital Field Recorder Plus (SM2+; Wildlife Acoustics Inc.) recorders, spaced every 200\u00a0m. To determine spacing distance between recorders, a fixed source was placed to reproduce a sound (the recorded song of a bird) and then recordings were made at distances from that source ranging from 100\u00a0m to 500\u00a0m. Later, these recordings were analyzed auditively and their spectrograms explored to choose the distance between recorders that allowed the independence in the collection of acoustic data. Two omnidirectional microphones were placed on each recorder, so recording was done through two channels, <i>i.e.<\/i>, in stereo. The quality of digital audio was compact disc with a sampling rate or frequency rate of 44.1\u00a0kHz and 16 bits resolution. The audio files were recorded in Microsoft Wave format (.wav). Audio files were stored on 64\u00a0GB Secure Digital High Capacity memory cards. At each recording site equipment was fixed to trees at a height of approximately 1.50\u00a0m. Recorders were programmed to make continuous recordings during peaks of bird activity (4\u20136 am and 4\u20136 pm), and during 10 minutes every hour for the remainder of the day; and stayed at each recording site for two consecutive days.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246236864\">To evaluate acoustic indices as indicators for biodiversity, specifically diversity, abundance and richness of birds, traditional methods of bird point counts were additionally performed. We conducted four periods of bird point counts at each recording site during the morning (6\u20139 am) and the afternoon (15\u201317 pm), periods where the maximum bird activity is usually recorded. Each counting period was performed for 6 minutes by the same observer throughout the study. With the bird data we obtained species richness (Bird Richness), mean abundance (Bird Abundance), Shannon diversity (Bird Diversity; <a href=\"#fn56\" id=\"xref56\">Shannon and Weaver, 1964<\/a>) and evenness (Bird Evenness; <a href=\"#fn46\" id=\"xref46\">Pielou, 1984<\/a>) for each sampling site.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246217248\">Recordings were analyzed to obtain a series of acoustic indices:<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246216800\">1) \u201cAcoustic Evenness Index\u201d (AEI) is calculated by dividing the spectrogram into bins (default 10) and taking the proportion of the signals in each bin above a threshold (default \u221250\u00a0dBFS). The AEI is the result of the Gini index applied to these bins (<a href=\"#fn65\" id=\"xref65\">Villanueva-Rivera and Pijanowski, 2018<\/a>); 2) \u201cADI\u201d is calculated by dividing the spectrogram into bins (default 10) and taking the proportion of the signals in each bin above a threshold (default \u221250 dBFS). The ADI is the result of the Shannon index applied to these bins (<a href=\"#fn65\" id=\"xref65\">Villanueva-Rivera and Pijanowski, 2018<\/a>); 3) \u201cACI\u201d for each frequency bin over the entire one minute recording, calculates the average absolute fractional change in spectral amplitude from one spectrum to the next; ACI for the entire recording is the average over all frequency bins. The ACI is based on the observation that many biotic sounds, such as bird songs, are characterized by an intrinsic variability of intensities, while some types of human generated noise (such as car passing or airplane transit) exhibit very constant intensity values (<a href=\"#fn47\" id=\"xref47\">Pieretti et al., 2011<\/a>); 4) \u201cBioacoustics Index\u201d (BIO) is calculated as the area under each curve including all frequency bands associated with the dB value that is greater than the minimum dB value for each curve. The area values are thus a function of both the sound level and the number of frequency bands used by the avifauna (<a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"xref7\">Boelman et al., 2007<\/a>); 5) \u201cNormalized Difference Soundscape Index\u201d (NDSI) estimates the level of anthropogenic disturbance on the soundscape by computing the ratio of human-generated (anthrophony) to biological (biophony) acoustic components found in field collected sound samples (<a href=\"#fn32\" id=\"xref32\">Kasten et al., 2012<\/a>); 6) \u201cTotal Entropy\u201d (TE) function estimates the total entropy of a time wave. The entropy of a noisy signal will tend towards one whereas the entropy of a pure tone signal will tend towards cero (<a href=\"#fn60\" id=\"xref60\">Sueur et al., 2008a<\/a>); 7) Median Amplitude Envelope (MAE) function computes an acoustic index based on the median of the amplitude envelope (<a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"xref14\">Depraetere et al., 2012<\/a>); and 8) \u201cNumber of Peaks\u201d (NP) is built by counting the number of major frequency peaks obtained on a mean spectrum. This index results from the assumption that spectral complexity of a sound can be assessed by the number of frequency bands occupied (<a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"xref23\">Gasc et al., 2013b<\/a>). In the case of ACI, ADI, AEI and BIO, filters with a minimum of 2,000 to a maximum frequency of 11,000\u00a0kHz were used. The indices were calculated for the first minute of each recording.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246154224\">For comparison of acoustic indices and bird point counts derived indices, we used the recordings corresponding to the time block used to perform the bird point counts, from 6\u20139 am and 15\u201317 pm. Otherwise, we present mean and standard deviation of acoustics indices, as well as graphic representation of indices for all sampling hours throughout the day.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246152448\">We reviewed each recording (by listening and exploring frequency plots) for extreme values, either due to climatic conditions, mainly rain or very strong wind, or to other animal explosive vocalization behavior (by frogs or insects). When we verified these extreme conditions, we proceeded to eliminate the corresponding 1\u2009min wav file.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45129246151488\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Data analysis<\/h4><p id=\"idm45129246150848\">We evaluated the distribution of acoustic indices by using boxplots to compare indices averages by time of the day and sampling site. To visually examine the spatial distribution and spatial patterns of both acoustics and point count derived indices, we created interpolated surfaces from indices for the study area. To further analyze these visual similarities, we created a sample of 60 random points for the study area, and extracted values from all interpolated surfaces for the location of these points. We finally run multiple correlation methods (Spearman correlation) to assess correlation between interpolated surfaces of all indices.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246202400\">Also, we conducted generalized linear models (GLM; Gamma family and log link) for each acoustic index\/bird point count derived index to further investigate influence of vegetation structure\/landscape metrics on indices. In this case, we previously evaluated correlation among vegetation and landscape variables and used a reduced subset of non-correlated variables including four vegetation variables (NTREES, BASALAREA, UNDERSTORY and CANOPY) and three landscape metrics (NumP, MPE and MPAR). We ran separate models for each acoustic index and bird point count derived index, and considered a total of 28 models (9 with only vegetation structure variables, 6 with only landscape metrics, and 13 with both variables), and finally compared them with Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). Best model and models with a delta AIC less than 2 are shown. Finally, we compared acoustic indices and bird point count derived indices using multiple correlation methods (Spearman correlation) to evaluate the efficiency of acoustic indices to represent biodiversity of birds in a tropical dry forest. We also used Spearman correlation to evaluate correlation among acoustic indices.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246201952\">All analyzes and plots were performed using the statistical language R (<a href=\"#fn52\" id=\"xref52\">R Development Core Team, 2017<\/a>). For calculation of acoustic indices, the following packages for R were used: \u201cSoundecology\u201d (<a href=\"#fn65\" id=\"xref65\">Villanueva-Rivera and Pijanowski, 2018<\/a>) and \u201cSeewave\u201d (<a href=\"#fn60\" id=\"xref60\">Sueur et al., 2008a<\/a>). We used BiodiversityR (<a href=\"#fn33\" id=\"xref33\">Kindt, 2018<\/a>) package for R to analyze bird data obtained from point counts. Spatial procedures were conducted using the Geostatistical Analyst extension for ArcGIS (<a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"xref17\">ESRI, 2016<\/a>).<\/p><\/div><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45129246797040\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">RESULTS<\/h3><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45129246796400\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Characterization of the study area and bird communities<\/h4><p id=\"idm45129246795792\">In general, a trend in the spatial patterns was observed from northern to southern section of the study area. The southern part of the study area presented the lowest diversity and lower equity (or greater dominance) in the abundance of classes of vegetation cover, and represented the most continuous and well preserved forested area, where even the only evergreen patch of the park was found. At the center of the study area we observed greater landscape diversity and greater equity of classes of vegetation cover. This area presented secondary forest patches interspersed with riverine forest patches, although central-east areas exhibited a more advanced successional stage than central-western areas. In general, we also observed in this central area higher number of patches, higher amount of edges, and smaller patches (<a href=\"#F2\">Figure 2<\/a>).<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F2\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/1d64a642-0128-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JEA-00011-2017-02_F0002_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/1d64a642-0128-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JEA-00011-2017-02_F0002_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/1d64a642-0128-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JEA-00011-2017-02_F0002.tif\" download=\"JEA-00011-2017-02_F0002.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 2 - Interpolated surfaces of landscape metrics in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica.<\/p><div class=\"fig-description\"><i>SDI: landscape Shannon diversity, NumP: number of patches, MPE: mean patch edge, MPS: mean patch size and MPAR: mean perimeter\/area ratio.

and an additional peak at 5 pm, except for ACI. These patterns were expected and consistent with the daily rhythms of bird activity. The dawn chorus is generally recognized as an acoustic peak time and has been widely reported in observational studies (<a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"xref28\">Henwood and Fabrick, 1979<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"xref6\">Berg et al., 2006<\/a>). Other authors have found that acoustic diversity indices are capable of detecting these activity patterns, both in temperate (<a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"xref14\">Depraetere et al., 2012<\/a>) and in tropical environments (<a href=\"#fn54\" id=\"xref54\">Rodrigues et al., 2014<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn64\" id=\"xref64\">Trigg, 2015<\/a>). <a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"xref27\">Hayes (2016)<\/a> also found the ACI showed its highest value around 5.30 am in the SRNP. However, this author found lowest values of ADI and TE at 6 pm, while in the present study one of the higher values for both indices was found at 5 pm.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246518896\">ACI might be representing acoustic patterns related to diurnal birds in the study area, which show an activity peak in the morning. On the other hand, the highest mean values of ADI, BIO and TE at 5 pm might be attributed to other organisms in addition to birds. <a href=\"#fn54\" id=\"xref54\">Rodrigues et al. (2014)<\/a> mentioned that dawn chorus is a particular time of activity for diurnal birds and other times are dominated by cicadas and amphibians. Furthermore, it has been postulated that the entropy index is affected by sounds that cover a wide spectrum, such as cicadas (<a href=\"#fn60\" id=\"xref60\">Sueur et al., 2008a<\/a>), which show peaks of activity in hours of the afternoon <a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"xref27\">Hayes (2016)<\/a>. <a href=\"#fn58\" id=\"xref58\">Stanley et al. (2016)<\/a> also found that cicadas produced an inhibitory effect on bird singing activity within the bandwidth of cicada calls; thus, insect noise appears to create a frequency-dependent constraint on the calling activity of birds, which might be overcome by temporal partitioning of acoustic space. In addition, we observed a tendency for higher values of indices derived from bird point counts in the morning compared to the afternoon, which might support this idea. However, other authors have found that ACI strongly responded to cicadas (<a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"xref16\">Duarte et al., 2015<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn48\" id=\"xref48\">Pieretti et al., 2015<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246596016\">On the other hand, the AEI index showed a temporal pattern contrary to that of ADI, BIO and TE. This is expected because of what these indices represent, since the AEI is denoting acoustic evenness, while the other indices represent heterogeneity and entropy, thus representing extremes in the same spectrum. Regarding NDSI, the highest value, <i>i.e.<\/i>, the highest proportion of biophony over antrophony, was found at 5 pm. This is consistent with the lowest intensity of human activity at the park, given that SRNP operates from 8 am to 4 pm.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246594544\">The results of this study were partially consistent with other studies that compared acoustic data with bird data. <a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"xref18\">Farina et al. (2011)<\/a> and <a href=\"#fn47\" id=\"xref47\">Pieretti et al. (2011)<\/a> tested the ACI to infer bird community activity in a temperate forest in Italy and found the ACI index described the complexity of bird soundscapes. <a href=\"#fn63\" id=\"xref63\">Towsey et al. (2014)<\/a> found that acoustic indices such as Ht, Hs and ACI were useful indicators of bioacoustic activity and species diversity, using field data obtained from shrub areas of the Samford Ecological Research Institute in Australia. <a href=\"#fn38\" id=\"xref38\">Machado et al. (2017)<\/a> found the ADI was significantly correlated to the number of bird species in the savannas of Central Brazil. However, in a similar study conducted in southern China, <a href=\"#fn39\" id=\"xref39\">Mammides et al. (2017)<\/a> found that although no index showed a very strong correlation with species richness or diversity, three indices (the acoustic entropy, acoustic diversity and acoustic evenness indices) performed consistently better, showing moderate correlations.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246587824\">In this study, most indices related to acoustic diversity or entropy behaved as expected, showing a higher diversity or entropy in areas where bird diversity or richness was higher as well. However, bird diversity showed a positive statistical relationship only to the number of peaks. But the very surprising and unexpected find was the positive and significant correlation between ACI and bird abundance derived from point counts, and even more the negative correlation between ACI and bird diversity or bird richness. A similar and unexpected pattern was found between BIO and bird indices, although no significant correlation was found in this case. Our expectations of a higher acoustic diversity, heterogeneity or complexity, and higher bird diversity in older and more preserved forests also were achieved, except for ACI and BIO. For instance, higher values of ACI, BIO, as well as bird abundance, were related to characteristics of younger forests.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246586400\">ACI and BIO seem to be reflecting efficiently a high biological activity, but might not necessarily be the case of a more diverse or complex bird community in this particular area. Younger forests usually present a high environmental heterogeneity both horizontally and vertically (<a href=\"#fn37\" id=\"xref37\">MacArthur and MacArthur, 1961<\/a>), providing a variety of niches for some opportunistic species, or a mixture of species with different life history characteristics. Some authors have stated that forests at earlier stages of succession maintain a greater dynamic of food production than mature forests (<a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"xref20\">Flores and Dezzeo, 2005<\/a>), which may gather several guilds of species (<a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"xref3\">Almaz\u00e1n-N\u00fa\u00f1ez et al., 2009<\/a>). This strong acoustic activity might be an indication of an ongoing acoustic competition in a less established bird community. According to the acoustic niche hypothesis, the soundscape is a limited resource where individuals must compete to communicate effectively; resulting in sound niches where the soundscape is spatially and temporally divided (<a href=\"#fn35\" id=\"xref35\">Krause, 1987<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn49\" id=\"xref49\">Pijanowski et al., 2011<\/a>). In addition, younger forests might be dominated by some bird species with a particular intense vocalizing behavior, which subsequently dominate the acoustic spectrum and influence acoustic indices.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246579424\">Other factors might affect acoustic indices, such as ACI and BIO. For example, there is a strong acoustic activity from other animal groups in tropical forests (mainly insects such as cicadas and crickets, as well as frogs), which play a significant role in the bioacoustic activity. According to <a href=\"#fn61\" id=\"xref61\">Sueur et al. (2014)<\/a> single species producing a noise like sound, like some cicadas do, might return higher values for certain indices, such as NP, than several species producing pure tone sound; and this bias may also affect other indices. Although we removed all those recordings extremely affected by insects and frogs explosions, it is necessary to acknowledge and account for their common presence in tropical forests.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246577184\">NP was positively correlated to Bird Diversity and also related to characteristics of older forests (such as a higher percentage of canopy cover and a lower number of patches at the landscape level). NP is built by counting the number of major frequency peaks obtained on a mean spectrum. The index results from the assumption that spectral complexity of a sound can be assessed by the number of frequency bands occupied. It is indeed expected that a sound produced by n + k species should contain more frequency peaks than a sound due to n species only (<a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"xref23\">Gasc et al., 2013b<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246512416\">Furthermore, ADI, TE, Bird Diversity and Bird Evenness were also related to characteristics of older forests (higher percentage of canopy cover and lower number of patches at the landscape level). The composition and richness of animal species, as well as temporal and spatial stability, increases as a forest is established (<a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"xref12\">Cook et al., 2005<\/a>). On the other hand, a better established forest usually contains a larger evolutionary history, and also has a higher density of woody trees compared to shrubs, which could facilitate the propagation of the sounds by providing a landscape with less attenuating elements (<a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"xref27\">Hayes, 2016<\/a>). Although older forests presented a higher basal area of trees than younger forests, they presented half the amount of understory shrubs in the study area, resulting in a noticeable clearer understory. As a result, values of acoustic indices would be expected to increase in more established forest areas, where landscape properties and competition for acoustic niches would lead to a more biodiverse soundscape (<a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"xref27\">Hayes, 2016<\/a>). Other authors also postulated that acoustic production of a community or landscape will increase in diversity with different individuals and species vocalizing, so it would be expected that more diverse communities in terms of number of species and individuals, are concurrently more diverse acoustic communities (<a href=\"#fn61\" id=\"xref61\">Sueur et al., 2014<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246506320\">NDSI behaved somewhat differently than other indices, because vegetation and landscape variables associated to that index were representative of younger or intermediate forests. In the case of NDSI, other confounding factors might be considered, such as proximity to the main road allowing access to the station at SRNP. For example, site 12 was located on a well preserved and evergreen forest patch in the study area, but also was located next to the main road to access the park, and consequently subjected to a persistent level of anthropophony.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246505312\">On the other hand, other authors recognized that a single index may not be sufficient to represent all the acoustic energy of a recording (<a href=\"#fn63\" id=\"xref63\">Towsey et al., 2014<\/a>). These authors postulate that although it is not possible to propose combinations of indexes applicable to all climates and environments, they recommend using weighted combinations of relevant indexes could provide more robust results than using single indexes. They proposed using a combination of indexes such as Ht, spectral entropy (Hs) and ACI. A variety of methods is most likely needed to thoroughly assess biodiversity on a site; however, given the efficacy of automated recording methods and results of the present study, a combination of indices such as ACI and NP might be considered to monitor long-term trends in abundance and diversity of birds in Costa Rican dry forests.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45129246502784\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Conclusions<\/h3><p id=\"idm45129246502144\">We conclude that acoustic indices have the potential to be used for monitoring trends in biodiversity in tropical ecosystems, although it might be worthwhile to adapt them to the special conditions in these environments. Acoustic indices have been created and applied mostly in temperate ecosystems, where bioacoustic activity can be referred to bird activity with adequate confidence. However, tropical ecosystems are rather more complex, consequently further investigation is necessary to assess influence of vocalizations from other animal groups, especially insects such as cicadas, on acoustic indices. Automatic procedures might be adapted to remove insect influence from recordings in specific studies. However, they are still part of the soundscape in tropical forests, although an unlikely target from a conservation perspective.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129246500848\">Future research might focus on analyzing the comparative value of combinations of indices to represent bird diversity in a locality. Further research is also needed on field sampling and resampling acoustic data schemes at appropriate minimum times in tropical forests. Given the importance of the vegetation structure in the estimated rates, it is necessary to replicate this study in humid forest types with different vegetation structure and microclimatic conditions, to validate the use of acoustic indices in such environments. Finally, to implement this method in tropical forests, appropriate and specific protocols must be designed for specific environmental conditions (for example forest type and climatic characteristics). Rigorous monitoring will allow comparisons of data in long-term studies focused on analyzing spatial-temporal trends in soundscapes related to changes in land use and climate. Furthermore, the general sampling of the soundscape could be complemented with specific studies on some species through the aid of the automated detection. For example, investigations on climate change effects, recordings and automated species detection can provides us with information on changes in species distribution, disappearance or appearance of species at different altitudinal or latitudinal ranges, which can be further complemented with a deeper analysis of vocalizing behavior in different environmental conditions or ranges.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div id=\"article-back\" class=\"back\"><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45129246497248\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Competing interests<\/h3><p id=\"idm45129246496144\">M\u00f3nica Retamosa Izaguirre, Oscar Ram\u00edrez-Al\u00e1n and Jorge De la O Castro declare that they have no conflicts of interest.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"back-section\"><a id=\"idm45129246498768\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Acknowledgements<\/h3><p id=\"idm45129246497968\">We thank to Christopher Vaughan for proof reading of the manuscript and recommendations.<\/p><\/div><h3 class=\"main-title\">Funding sources<\/h3><p>Universidad Nacional, Costa Rica.<\/p><h3 class=\"main-title\">Supporting material<\/h3><div><p><strong>Appendix 1.

Here we investigate which of six acoustic indices better correlate with the 24\u00a0h zoophony richness of insects, anurans, birds, and mammals. We sampled one minute every 30 minutes for seven days on three sites in Serra da Canastra National Park (Minas Gerais state, Brazil) and extracted the sonotype richness and six indices based on recordings with a bandwidth of up to 48\u00a0kHz. The Acoustic Diversity, Evenness, Entropy, and Normalized Difference Soundscape indices followed the temporal trends of the sonotype richness of insects and anurans. The Acoustic Complexity (ACI) and Bioacoustic (BIO) indices did not correlated with sonotype richness. ACI and BIO were influenced by sonic abundance and geophony. We emphasize the need to include insects and anurans on soundscape and acoustic ecology analyses and to avoid bias on avian fauna alone. We also suggest that future studies explore measures of sonic abundance and acoustic niche occupation of sonotypes to complement measures of zoophony richness and better understand what each faunal group is telling us about indices.<\/p><\/div>\n",

The soundscape is comprised of various sound sources, including biotic and abiotic components. The biotic component of the soundscape has been defined as Biophony (arguably Zoophony): the collective sounds produced by living organisms in nature. Geophony is comprised by sounds produced by geophysical elements, and Anthropophony comprises sounds of anthropogenic origins (<a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"xref27\">Pijanowski et al., 2011a<\/a>,<a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"xref28\">b<\/a>). Soundscape ecology aims to understand the structure and dynamics of ecological processes that are mediated or can be described by sounds. On the other hand, Ecoacoustics has been recently described as the discipline that includes soundscape ecology and other research that incorporate both sound and ecology (<a href=\"#fn41\" id=\"xref41\">Sueur and Farina, 2015<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593185904\">The application of acoustic methods to study ecology at the population and the community levels is increasing. Such methods deploy non-invasive technologies capable of generating large amounts of data on varying temporal and spatial scales (<a href=\"#fn45\" id=\"xref45\">Van Parijs et al., 2009<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"xref6\">Duarte et al., 2015<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn38\" id=\"xref38\">Stepanian et al., 2016<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"xref19\">Leach et al., 2016<\/a>). The use of autonomous recorders brings an additional advantage, since it is independent of the observer presence and enables long-term recordings, allowing for sampling in large temporal scales and at multiple simultaneous locations (<a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"xref3\">Bardeli et al., 2010<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"xref13\">Holmes et al., 2014<\/a>). As such, acoustic variances can be compared among sites, accounting for landscape structure and heterogeneity.<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593261472\">Data generated through automatic recordings can be used to answer multiple questions but the large amount of data collected implies challenges for its management and analysis. In this context, different acoustic indices have been developed to aid the interpretation of these large data sets. The extraction of acoustic indices would be a good solution to those challenges, since they would be capable of summarizing the structure and distribution of the acoustic energy in a recording, in order to reflect contents of ecological interest (<a href=\"#fn43\" id=\"xref43\">Towsey et al., 2014<\/a>). Some of the existing indices are calculated in order to estimate the amplitude, equitability, richness, heterogeneity, and temporal patterns of a community or soundscape (<a href=\"#fn42\" id=\"xref42\">Sueur et al., 2014<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593343936\">However, the development of acoustic indices is still incipient and may suffer various biases (such as interference from different levels of background anthropic noise; <a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"xref11\">Gasc et al., 2015<\/a>). Further studies are needed to increase the reliability of acoustic indices as robust analytical tools for ecology applications (<a href=\"#fn42\" id=\"xref42\">Sueur et al., 2014<\/a>). <i>In situ<\/i> physical measurements and manual analyses of recordings are still frequently needed to verify and validate the information provided by them and to help improve the way they are extracted. Ecologically important phenomena, such as the impact of climate change on biodiversity, are occurring quickly and reliable indices capable of describing changes in landscapes due to these kinds of phenomena with an efficient processing time are in high demand (<a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"xref17\">Krause and Farina, 2016<\/a>). Biodiversity hot-spot areas are also disappearing fast and would benefit from a methodology capable of quickly assessing their large scale characteristics and trends to advise conservation actions while there is still time to yield positive results (<a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"xref20\">Machado et al., 2017<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593281024\">The relationship between acoustic indices and species richness has been studied in the Cerrado (<a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"xref26\">Pieretti et al., 2015<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"xref20\">Machado et al., 2017<\/a>). However, all inferences were restricted to birds (<a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"xref20\">Machado et al., 2017<\/a>) or emphasized the avian contribution to the zoophony using a single index (<a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"xref25\">Pieretti et al., 2015<\/a>). These examples highlight the fact that soundscape ecology has been dominated by research focused on ornithology (<a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"xref4\">Boelman et al., 2007<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"xref7\">Farina et al., 2011<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"xref5\">Depraetere et al., 2012<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"xref26\">Pieretti et al., 2011<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"xref14\">Kasten et al., 2012<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn43\" id=\"xref43\">Towsey et al., 2014<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn44\" id=\"xref44\">Tucker et al., 2014<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"xref9\">Fuller et al., 2015<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"xref10\">Gasc et al., 2017<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"xref20\">Machado et al., 2017<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"xref21\">Mammides et al., 2017<\/a>). This bias is to be expected in the early steps of this emerging methodology, since birds are conspicuous, diverse, relatively easy to identify at the species level, diurnal and concentrated temporally during the dawn chorus, which makes visual validation of the recordings much simpler (<a href=\"#fn48\" id=\"xref48\">Wimmer et al., 2013<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"xref2\">Alquezar and Machado, 2015<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593211440\">The need for integrating anuran, insect, and mammalian data to complement avian data into soundscape analyses, including the nocturnal biodiversity, has already been pointed out by some authors (<a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"xref9\">Fuller et al., 2015<\/a>). Broadening the range of sonic fauna in soundscape research would help explain cases of poor association between some acoustic indices and bird diversity (<a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"xref21\">Mammides et al., 2017<\/a>) as well as drive the soundscape ecology field towards a more comprehensive characterization of the zoophony.<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593223536\">Here we aim to describe the 24\u00a0h temporal acoustic richness pattern of four different animal groups contributing energy to the soundscape (anurans, birds, insects and mammals) at three sites within a Cerrado protected area and to investigate which of six selected acoustic indices better corresponds to the zoophony patterns found.<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593226352\">We predict that the acoustic entropy (H; <a href=\"#fn40\" id=\"xref40\">Sueur et al., 2008b<\/a>) and the Acoustic Diversity Index (ADI; <a href=\"#fn47\" id=\"xref47\">Villanueva-Rivera et al., 2011<\/a>) will not be specific to any faunal group and correlate more strongly with total zoophony richness. We also predict that the Acoustic Evenness Index (AEI; <a href=\"#fn47\" id=\"xref47\">Villanueva-Rivera et al., 2011<\/a>) will be different in each of the three recording sites even if they have similar zoophony richness values, as the species composition may result in different acoustic niche partitioning. Signals are under selective pressure to be received, which can drive acoustic niche partitioning to avoid masking and competition by other sonic entities (<a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"xref16\">Krause, 1987<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"xref28\">Pijanowski et al., 2011b<\/a>). The Normalized Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI; <a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"xref14\">Kasten et al., 2012<\/a>) should vary according to the anthropophony but some studies have found a relationship of this index with biophony (<a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"xref9\">Fuller et al., 2015<\/a>). Inasmuch, we have included this index predicting that NDSI will be sensitive to diurnal and nocturnal zoophony richness as found by <a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"xref9\">Fuller et al. (2015)<\/a>. Finally, we predict that the Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI; <a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"xref26\">Pieretti et al., 2011<\/a>) and the Bioacoustic index (BIO; <a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"xref4\">Boelman et al., 2007<\/a>), which measure biophonic activity, will correlate with zoophony richness of the predominant groups.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46196593295184\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Materials and methods<\/h3><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46196593297504\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Study area and recording sites<\/h4><p id=\"idm46196593297872\">The Cerrado is a vast tropical savanna ecoregion in Brazil, and the only tropical savanna region acknowledged by <a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"xref23\">Myers et al.

Cropland expansion is the main threat for this habitat, which has lost more than half of its original area (<a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"xref8\">Fran\u00e7oso et al., 2015<\/a>) since less than 2.2% of the area is protected (<a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"xref15\">Klink and Machado, 2005<\/a>). The Cerrado has over 12,000 species of vascular plants, of which 4,252 are endemic (<a href=\"#fn36\" id=\"xref36\">Silva and Bates, 2002<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn49\" id=\"xref49\">Zappi et al., 2015<\/a>). Phytophysiognomies in the Cerrado are predominantly savannas, but it also comprises habitats that range from open grassland to closed canopy forests, as well as gallery forests adjacent to perennial water courses (<a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"xref24\">Oliveira-Filho and Ratter, 2002<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn36\" id=\"xref36\">Silva and Bates, 2002<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593333056\">The recordings were made at Serra da Canastra National Park, located southwest of Minas Gerais state, Brazil (<a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1<\/a>).

The park is open to public from 08:00 a.m. to 06:00 p.m., but received very few visitors on the recording days due to the beginning of the rainy season (<a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"xref22\">MMA\/IBAMA, 2005<\/a>; personal observation of the absence of vehicle sounds on the recordings). Site geographical coordinates were: A -20.203790 -46.507400, B -20.261250 -46.411920, and C -20.224520 -46.557210 (decimal degrees, WGS 84 datum).<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593382624\">Site A (<a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1<\/a>) was situated within an open grassland area (<i>campo limpo<\/i>; <a href=\"#fn31\" id=\"xref31\">Ribeiro and Walter, 1998<\/a>) located 11.97\u00a0km from the park entrance. This site is not accessible to park visitors and is located 3\u00a0km away from the closest road. This was the site with the least anthropic influence. Site B was located 45\u00a0m from the main park road (dirt road) and 193\u00a0m from the park entrance, where the vegetation is comprised of tall grass, shrub and a few low trees (<i>campo sujo<\/i>; <a href=\"#fn31\" id=\"xref31\">Ribeiro and Walter, 1998<\/a>). This was the site with the highest anthropic influence, as vehicle traffic is common during the touristic season and urban and rural areas are closer than to the other sites. Additionally, there is a small stream alongside the road at site B. Site C was located 15.90\u00a0km from the park entrance and 45\u00a0m from a secondary dirt road, where vegetation was limited to shrubs and short trees (<i>cerrado ralo<\/i>; <a href=\"#fn31\" id=\"xref31\">Ribeiro and Walter, 1998<\/a>).

We used the Song Meter SM2+ Configuration Utility software version 3.2.4 (Wildlife Acoustics, Inc.) to program the equipment to record one minute each 30 minutes for seven days at a sampling rate of 96\u00a0kHz and 16 bit WAV coding form. This configuration yielded 336 one-minute files for each site. All 1,008 files were used in the analyses.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46196593280080\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Sonotype counting<\/h4><p id=\"idm46196593342880\">We conducted a manual account of the zoophony by counting sonotypes, <i>i.e.<\/i>, the equivalent to \u201cacoustic morphospecies\u201d used by <a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"xref1\">Aide et al. (2017)<\/a>. Those authors define an acoustic morphospecies (or sonotype) as a note or series of notes uniquely distinct that represents one type of vocalization of a species. If a series of different notes is uttered together, the entire set was classified as a single sonotype. As noted by <a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"xref1\">Aide et al. (2017)<\/a>, while each sonotype probably represents a single species of insects and anurans, in birds a one-to-one match is less likely since many species have multiple vocalizations or may mimic the calls of another species.<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593215008\">We emphasize that sonotype counting here is a measure of richness, not an abundance estimate: each sonotype was counted only once per minute file as a potential species, independent of the number of times it appears in each one-minute file. Nonetheless, one sonotype can, and normally do, reappear on the same file and in other files. Different from <a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"xref1\">Aide et al. (2017)<\/a> who measured sonotype richness per area, here we were interested in the 24h variation patterns and measured sonotype richness per minute file, i.e., sonotypes were counted again if they reappear in another file.<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593286064\">Sonotypes were identified according to the analysts auditory perception and spectrogram characteristics on Raven Pro 1.5 software (Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY; <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.birds.cornell.edu\/raven\" id=\"idm46196593342144\">www.birds.cornell.edu\/raven<\/a>). This methodology was an adaptation of those from <a href=\"#fn32\" id=\"xref32\">Riede (1996)<\/a> and <a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"xref13\">Gasc et al. (2013)<\/a>, being equivalent to that of <a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"xref1\">Aide et al. (2017)<\/a>. Each one-minute file was viewed as a spectrogram which was generated in a range of window FFT sizes varying from 512 to 4,096 points (Hann window type) so that the resulting visual representation was most fitted to each type of sound. Each different sound was counted and classified into four categories: insect, anuran, bird or mammal (See <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.veruscript.com\/a\/PVH6YZ\/S.1.png\" id=\"idm46196593267568\">Figure S1<\/a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.veruscript.com\/a\/PVH6YZ\/Table S2.xlsx\" id=\"idm46196593273712\">Table S2<\/a> on the supplementary material).<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593290480\">Manual sonotype counting was divided among four different analysts who each browsed and processed part of the data. Three analyst were responsible for files from five non consecutive days (240 files) and one was responsible for files from six non consecutive days (288 files). Each day was composed of 48 sequential one-minute files (one every half hour) in each of the three sites (a total of 21 sampled days). Distribution among analysts was done ensuring that no single person was responsible for an entire site or the same day at different sites to avoid observer bias. All analysts had experience in bioacoustics and in the use of Raven software but were not specialists in any of the particular animal groups cited. When analysts did not reach a consensus on which category sonotypes belonged to, those sonotypes were sent to specialists for identification.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46196593292688\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Acoustic indices<\/h4><p id=\"idm46196593294816\">Six acoustic indices (ADI, AEI, H, NDSI, ACI and BIO) were calculated on R statistical program (<a href=\"#fn30\" id=\"xref30\">R Development Core Team,  2014<\/a>) with the function \u201cmultiple_sounds\u201d from the packages \u201csoundecology package\u201d (<a href=\"#fn46\" id=\"xref46\">Villanueva-Rivera and Pijanowski, 2016<\/a>) and \u201cseewave-R\u201d (<a href=\"#fn39\" id=\"xref39\">Sueur et al., 2008a<\/a>). Those indices were selected to compare our results with other papers that investigate the diel patterns of acoustic indices (<a href=\"#fn47\" id=\"xref47\">Villanueva-Rivera et al., 2011<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"xref9\">Fuller et al., 2015<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593304688\">ADI calculates the Shannon diversity index considering each frequency band as a different category, <i>i.e.<\/i>, species, and the proportion of an occurring sound in each band as the frequency, <i>i.e.<\/i>, abundance (<a href=\"#fn47\" id=\"xref47\">Villanueva-Rivera et al., 2011<\/a>). The greater the number of active bands and the more even the proportion of their activity, the more diverse the acoustic community. AEI also uses the amount of activity in each frequency bin but instead, applies the Gini coefficient to measure how even the occupancy distribution is (<a href=\"#fn47\" id=\"xref47\">Villanueva-Rivera et al., 2011<\/a>). The closer the index is to 1 the less even the acoustic community is. H has a similar concept to that of the ADI, also using Shannon\u2019s index in a more complex calculation that results from the product of a time diversity index and a frequency diversity index based on amplitude envelopes (<a href=\"#fn40\" id=\"xref40\">Sueur et al., 2008b<\/a>). NDSI was designed to estimate the proportion of anthropogenic disturbance in a soundscape (<a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"xref14\">Kasten et al., 2012<\/a>). It does so by comparing the greater biophony bin spectral power area (\u03b1) with the spectral power area of a predefined anthropophony bin (\u03b2) using the formula (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2)\/(\u03b1 + \u03b2). Positive values correspond to the prevalence of biophony whereas negative values result from high anthropophony levels. ACI was designed to measure biophony activity independent of anthropophony based on the assumption that biotic sounds vary in intensities while human related noise show constant intensities (<a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"xref26\">Pieretti et al., 2011<\/a>). BIO is also an abundance index originally proposed to measure relative avian song abundance by calculating the area under the normalized power spectrum that is greater than the minimum intensity of the curve (<a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"xref4\">Boelman et al., 2007<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593204160\">For ADI and AEI, the maximum frequency was set to 48,000\u00a0Hz and the freq_step was set to 1,000\u00a0Hz. The ACI and BIO were calculated excluding the first 300\u00a0Hz, which contains mainly wind noise (Geophony). For the NDSI we considered the 100\u2013300\u00a0Hz band as containing anthropophony and the 300\u201343,000\u00a0Hz band containing biophony (zoophony). The inferior threshold for ACI, BIO and NDSI is lower than used in most papers. Nonetheless, we chose this threshold to avoid excluding from the biophony mammal and anuran sounds previously observed in this frequency band during manual sonotype counting. All other settings were left as the default values (<a href=\"#fn46\" id=\"xref46\">Villanueva-Rivera and Pijanowski, 2016<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593222240\">Due to equipment failure some of files are less than 60 seconds long (min. = 47\u00a0s). The ACI is a temporal cumulative index (<a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"xref26\">Pieretti et al., 2011<\/a>) and thus would be influenced by different durations of samples. To balance this and make ACI indices comparable, we divided the ACI values by the duration (in seconds) of the files, as recommended in the R \u201csoundecology package\u201d manual (<a href=\"#fn46\" id=\"xref46\">Villanueva-Rivera and Pijanowski, 2016<\/a>). The balanced values may be very different from other studies and are referred here as ACI\/s.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46196593278512\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Statistical analyses<\/h4><p id=\"idm46196593339984\">Sonotype richness variation along the 24 hours was plotted using the mean value (N=7) calculated from counts of different sonotypes within each half hour (48 points) of 7 different days. The same was done for the acoustic indices, resulting in a 24 h temporal series including all data. Additionally, a 24 h series was calculated for each of the three sites separately. We chose to work with 24 h means instead of a continuous temporal series from the 7 consecutive days of recording to reveal diel zoophonic patterns for sonotype richness and acoustic indices. Those patterns better represent site characteristics than isolated days and can be an effective way of describing local soundscape structure and discriminating among sites (<a href=\"#fn47\" id=\"xref47\">Villanueva-Rivera et al., 2011<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"xref12\">Gasc et al., 2013<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"xref9\">Fuller et al., 2015<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593306160\">Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests indicated that our sample did not have a normal distribution. The 24\u00a0h mean series of indices and manual sonotype counts were compared with Spearman\u2019s correlation and a regression analysis was conducted for ADI. To test differences among sites we averaged the variables in two subsets according to local sunrise and sunset (day: 05:30 a.m. to 06:00 p.m.; night: 06:30 p.m. to 05:00 a.m.). Manual sonotype counts and acoustic indices were then compared with a Kruskal-Wallis test and subsequent Mann-Whitney post hoc Bonferroni corrected tests (15 comparisons; final significance level 0.0033). All statistical analyses were conducted in SPSS Statistic 17.0 (SPSS, Inc. 2011. Chicago, IL, USA).<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593305872\">Minimum distance between sites was 5\u00a0km (Site A to C). This distance was considered sufficient for sites to be independent in the time window used (seven days). Some mammals, as maned wolves, may travel such distances daily, but we registered this species only once in this study. Accounts of other mammals included only bats. Besides, overall mammal count was low enough to have negligible effects on site independency.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46196593402352\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Additional tests<\/h4><p id=\"idm46196593269456\">We compared our results controlling for some potential sources of variation by comparing datasets.

Insect and anuran sonotype richness was higher in the first half of the night. Mammals had a very low sonotype count and were also concentrated at night. When observing the total sonotype richness pattern for the Cerrado, a dawn and dusk chorus is clearly perceptible, although the dusk chorus is more influenced by a rise in the number of insect rather than bird sonotypes. Maximum sonotype value in a single file was 15, minimum 0 and average 4.35.

For sites A and B, diurnal sonotype richness was higher than at night. This last result can be explained by a more pronounced drop in the diel pattern of sonotype richness in the middle of the day in site C than in the other two sites. Site C showed a more intense bird dusk chorus when compared to the other two sites. However, day and night bird sonotype means were equal for all sites.<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593373808\">Indices variation among sites is shown in Figure 4.

The biggest changes occurred in calculations of BIO (0.75 change in value) and ADI (0.2 change in value), but even those changes were considered small enough not to impact our results. Therefore, here we only show the results from the analyses of the original files, noise included.<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593359072\">Exclusion of the rainy days smoothed the diel patterns of ACI\/s in site C, which made the variation in its values clearer: a marked increase between 20\u00a0h and 21\u00a0h 30 and a decrease during the day (data not shown). ACI\/s and BIO correlation coefficients in site C increased for bird and total sonotype richness and in the other two sites increased for insect and total sonotype richness (data not shown). As significant differences occurred only in the abundance indices and as we did not account for abundance, comparisons were not possible, therefore we choose to leave those results in the original form as well.<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593360160\">NDSI calculated with commonly used frequency bins (1\u20132\u00a0kHz anthropophony\/2\u201310\u00a0kHz biophony) still resulted in negative diurnal values and positive nocturnal values, with even greater differences between day and night (data not shown). The values were more similar between sites, with only site B presenting higher diurnal values than site C. Similarly to the other additional test we decided to consider the analyses bins that best fit our data.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46196593357424\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Discussion<\/h3><p id=\"idm46196593263824\">As noted before, we aimed to describe variation in 24\u00a0h zoophony patterns and therefore, measured sonotype richness per minute file (<i>i.e.<\/i>, the same sonotype would be counted more than once along the day if it reappeared in different one-minute files). <a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"xref1\">Aide et al. (2017)<\/a> had a different approach because those authors were interested in comparing locations and measured total sonotype richness of each area (<i>i.e.<\/i>, the same sonotype was counted only once per location independent of the number of files it appeared).<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593199920\">Considering the data we used we did not find support for our prediction that ADI and H would follow the total zoophony richness trend (which included all four animal groups). Instead, ADI and H followed the temporal trends of the sonotype richness of insects and anurans, which was also the case for the other diversity indices (NDSI and AEI). This emphasizes the need to include anurans and insects on soundscape analyses and avoid to bias on avian fauna alone. NDSI was not sensitive to diurnal zoophony nor did AEI point differences between sites or periods with the same zoophony richness (<a href=\"#F3\">Figures 3<\/a> <a href=\"#F4\">and 4<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593207120\">Also contrary to our predictions, in general, the indices of biophonic activity (ACI\/s and BIO) did not correlate with the diel sonotype richness pattern of the most prevalent groups (birds and insects). In fact, ACI\/s and BIO did not follow any animal group temporal trend, nor the total sonotype richness which included sonotype counts of all groups combined. Those indices (especially BIO) discriminated sites well because they take into account the abundance of biophony, which also resulted in differences of ACI\/s and BIO during periods with the same richness (<a href=\"#F4\">Figure 4<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593218320\">The diel pattern of the diversity indices tested here (ADI, H and NDSI) correlated with the sonotype richness of specific taxonomic groups, positively for nocturnal sonic groups, and negatively for diurnal sonic groups (inversely for AEI). The correlations were stronger for anurans followed by insects, reinforcing the notion that these are the animal groups that have more to say about soundscape indices!<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593320256\">The sampled period coincides with the insect abundance period for the Cerrado (<a href=\"#fn38\" id=\"xref38\">Silva et al., 2011<\/a>), which might have biased our results. Insect stridulation had a greater influence on indices than anuran calls because they were more pervasive in all files. Anurans appeared in only 30.3% of files, their chorus rarely formed a continuous band on spectrograms, and anuran sonotypes occupied a narrow band (all below 3.8\u00a0kHz, see <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.veruscript.com\/a\/PVH6YZ\/Table S2.xlsx\" id=\"idm46196593366944\">Table S2<\/a>). By contrast, insects were present in 82.5% of files, their chorus had a high duty cycle and formed continuous bands at a large temporal scale. Insect sonotypes were found up to 48\u00a0kHz (although most concentrated between 2.5\u20137\u00a0kHz). A recent study counting sonotypes (acoustic morphospecies) also found that insect richness was the main driver of acoustic space use (<a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"xref1\">Aide et al., 2017<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593314144\">Higher correlation coefficients for anurans than for insects may have arisen due to the nature of our data. We measured richness and not diversity, the latter also takes into consideration the abundance of sounds. Diversity indices use both occupation of frequencies and time. Occupation in time is sometimes viewed as a correlate of species abundance (<a href=\"#fn47\" id=\"xref47\">Villanueva-Rivera et al., 2011<\/a>). That could mean that the 24\u00a0h diversity pattern indicated by the diversity indices (low-day and high-night values) was a result of differences in the distribution of values between anurans and insects. The anurans were virtually absent during the day as opposed to the insects that stridulate during the day but more (or more individuals stridulating) at night. This results in a similar value for richness and abundance for anurans, and a discrepancy in those values for insects. Future investigation on the sonic abundance of those taxonomic groups is needed to clarify this issue.<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593303408\">We fail to find relationships between acoustic indices and bird sonotype richness. The broad frequency bandwidth (0\/0.3 to 48\u00a0kHz) used in the analyses may have reduced the relative impact of birds on the indices as they occupy a more restricted frequency band. Alternatively, even when using a much more limited bandwidth (0\u201310\u00a0kHz) acoustic indices have been correlated negatively with bird richness and\/or presented high values at night (<a href=\"#fn47\" id=\"xref47\">Villanueva-Rivera et al., 2011<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"xref9\">Fuller et al., 2015<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"xref21\">Mammides et al., 2017<\/a>). Therefore, analyses bandwidth might not have such strong leverage on the relative importance of animals groups to acoustic indices. Insects and anurans might be influencing those indices more than birds, even in lower frequency bands. In fact, most insect and all anuran sonotypes occupied frequencies below 7\u00a0kHz (see <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.veruscript.com\/a\/PVH6YZ\/Table S2.xlsx\" id=\"idm46196593199232\">Table S2<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593198320\">Detection of mammal sonotypes were rare (6.6% of files) and comprised almost in its entirety on bats (except for a single file with maned wolf calls \u2014 <i>Chrysocyon brachyurus<\/i>). It should be noted that many bats vocalize at higher frequencies than we recorded (<a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"xref18\">Kunz and Brock, 1975<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn34\" id=\"xref34\">Russo and Jones, 2003<\/a>) which probably biased our sonotype counts towards the lower frequency vocalizing species. All the above indicates the methodology used here is not efficient to adequately account for mammal richness. Recording at appropriate frequencies, continuously, for longer periods, followed by automated detection (<a href=\"#fn33\" id=\"xref33\">Rocha et al., 2015<\/a>) would be a better approach.<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593171200\">Although we identified airplane noise on our data, they are very rare and there were no vehicle traffic at all nor other human associated sounds in our sample. Overall, NDSI did not perform better than the other indices tested here. For instance, different from the work of <a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"xref9\">Fuller et al. (2015)<\/a>, this index was only sensitive to nocturnal biophony instead of presenting an additional diurnal pattern related to birds. Hence, we do not recommend the use of NDSI for soundscape analyses of sites with similar low anthropophony.<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593147840\">AEI did not differ between sites or periods with the same richness among sites. As we did not measured differences in sonotypes across sites or differences in sonotype acoustic niche occupation (both could be an acoustic correlate of beta diversity) we cannot be sure if the studied sites really have similar acoustic niche occupation \u2014 or even same species composition and abundance \u2014 or if the AEI was not sensitive to site differences. <a href=\"#fn47\" id=\"xref47\">Villanueva-Rivera et al. (2011)<\/a>, who proposed the ADI and AEI, also showed similar results for both indices.<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593365360\">Biophony activity indices (ACI and BIO) did not correlated with the predominant groups (birds and insects) or with total sonotype richness unless rain is excluded (see \u201cadditional tests\u201d in the Results session). Even when we excluded the rain they fail to show the bird dawn and dusk choruses (except for BIO in site B), which was detectable in the manual inspection of files. These periods of highest zoophonic activity are clearly visible in the sonotype richness pattern of all three sites as well as in other studies with ACI and BIO (<a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"xref9\">Fuller et al., 2015<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"xref10\">Gasc et al., 2017<\/a>). The overlapping bird songs of many species and individuals might have resulted in a relatively constant intensity band, which at least for the ACI\/s, would impair biophony detection (<a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"xref26\">Pieretti et al., 2011<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"xref11\">Gasc et al., 2015<\/a>). <a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"xref21\">Mammides et al. (2017)<\/a> reported low performance of the ACI in a region of high bird richness. Even removing the two days with more rain our data may still contain occasional rain noise and a large amount of wind noise derived from setting a lower frequency filter during data acquisition than in most bird focused studies (300\u00a0Hz instead of 2,000\u00a0Hz). ACI and BIO appear to be very sensitive to geophony (and probably some anthropophony types; <a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"xref26\">Pieretti et al., 2011<\/a>) requiring substantial data filtering to yield robust correspondence to biological events (<a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"xref4\">Boelman et al., 2007<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"xref5\">Depraetere et al., 2012<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"xref11\">Gasc et al., 2015<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593408624\">We conclude that ADI and H were the indices that better corresponded to the tropical savanna zoophony richness and that they were mainly influenced by insect and anuran sounds. Regarding the others indices, future studies on sonic abundance and acoustic niche occupation are needed to complement our inferences. Future effort should focus on how insect sonic abundance influences indices in comparison to their acoustic richness and if AEI, ACI\/s, and BIO are reflecting sonic abundance and niche occupation among sites and periods with the same calculated richness.<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593251360\">Although bird sonic data alone are used as proxies for soundscape structure, overall species richness and habitat health (<a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"xref26\">Pieretti et al., 2011<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"xref14\">Kasten et al., 2012<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn43\" id=\"xref43\">Towsey et al., 2014<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn44\" id=\"xref44\">Tucker et al., 2014<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"xref10\">Gasc et al., 2017<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"xref21\">Mammides et al., 2017<\/a>), acoustic indices based only on avian sounds may not be sufficient to account for overall richness. Here, avian sonic richness did not vary across sites, but local differences in zoophony were better captured by insects. In fact, no single animal group would provide a complete scenario about acoustic ecology. Therefore, we suggest including other taxonomic groups when investigating zoophony richness. Insects and anurans are highly acoustically active, being important contributors to the sonic world and not accounting for them will generate an incomplete description and understanding of soundscapes and underlying acoustic ecological processes. Insects, in particular, seem to be important determinants of the acoustic space use (<a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"xref1\">Aide et al., 2017<\/a>) and therefore central to the partitioning of acoustic niches (<a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"xref16\">Krause, 1987<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"xref28\">Pijanowski et al., 2011b<\/a>). Proper investigation of terrestrial soundscapes should at least include insects, anurans and birds on the analyses.<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593310112\">We should reinforce that in this study we used a limited number of sites resulting in a lack of site replicates. Also, sonotype counting involves a degree of subjectivity that will always be a limitation to this approach. We believe this methodology is very promising and performed well despite the small number of sites.<\/p><p id=\"idm46196593309328\">In order to validate and better understand indices, we suggest exploring measures of sonic abundance and acoustic niche occupation of sonotypes besides richness. Also, it would be ideal to measure geophony and anthropophony to understand their influence on indices and on soundscapes. Finally, we suggest further refinement of acoustic methodologies so that one may be able to discriminate between taxonomic groups and even allowing for ranking their contribution to the overall zoophony. By doing so, one could potentially detect ecological interactions among animal communities, <i>e.g.<\/i>, prey-predator interactions, which, in the end, is the acoustic ecology we are so fascinated with.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div id=\"article-back\" class=\"back\"><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46196593352240\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Competing interests<\/h3><p id=\"idm46196593351440\">All authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"back-section\"><a id=\"idm46196593414304\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Acknowledgements<\/h3><p id=\"idm46196593413504\">We thank Elaine Cunha for producing the map.

We cannot close our ears, so as sight gives information, sound sets us in the midst of a world. How can we be sure that sound world is real? The hyperreal touches something in all of us. In sound, this is equivalent to Hollywood\u2019s idea of the jungle, where monkeys are actually an Australian bird, the Laughing Kookaburra, because seems somehow better than reality. Or too much reverb, or too many sounds swirling all around inside our heads when we\u2019re wearing headphones, that mosquito droning inside our brain looking for somewhere to sting. We know it is easy to be seduced by technology into the hyper-real, what philosopher Timothy Morton calls the <i>hyperobject<\/i> (<a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"xref9\">Morton, 2013<\/a>). This kind of sound doesn\u2019t take you there but to a there that exists nowhere.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929138269056\">There is a kind of nature photography where everything gels together, a mixture of beautiful subtlety and perhaps the wonderful precision of technology. A precise shot of an eagle catching a fish, the kind of thing only professionals used to be able to grab, but now the sheer opportunity to shoot thousands of images with exact lenses is now more easily accessible than ever before. More of us can have the technology, that\u2019s one thing, but on the other hand, noticing the possibility for beauty is as important as having the right technology.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929138270384\">Much more has written about the visual than about the aural, perhaps because it is easy to keep staring at images and wonder what they mean while sound quickly escapes our grasp the moment it arrives. Sometimes attention begins with an idea. Like that unusual <i>National Geographic<\/i> cover photo of Yosemite that tries to show night and day in the same image (<a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"xref13\">Wilkes, 2016<\/a>). Actually, the photographer tries to show all the best shadows and light on each part of Half Dome and the whole valley by stitching together hundreds of images of the same scene, taking the best coloration and shading from each, from midnight through sunset, kind of a time-lapse single image of one spectacular site in the world.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929138271696\">Stephen Wilkes is trying to make a single image show the procession of time, time over a landscape where no things move in it. It is the visual equivalent of an hour long recording that might claim to be \u201ca day in the life of a rainforest\u201d where all the sounds you need to hear are heard, from a rainstorm to a coqui to a screaming pitta to a jaguar, even though in any one hour you would never hear these things. It is a musical composition in sound, trying to bring nature into your ears, into your head but outside your head, to offer up the wilderness as an image in the heart of civilization.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929138272224\">Critics have made fun of this honorable desire for centuries. Remember Diderot\u2019s famous essay on the Salon of 1767 where he is supposed to review an exhibition of landscape painting by Vernet and refuses to go into the gallery, instead heading straight for the forests which the paintings purport to represent (<a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"xref1\">Diderot, 1995<\/a>). Of course, this is a better place to be! Perhaps our nature-inspired works exist solely to continually remind us of the superiority of nature to art. We are all children of artifice, and can never totally live in the midst of nature no matter how much we pretend. We need to be reminded what is great about this world from whence we came.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929138274224\">Or John Muir taking a tour group of artist to Tuolomne Meadows, as they endlessly search for just the right view to paint, the perfect place to set up their easels. He gets so fed up with this crew that he disappears for a few days into the very landscape they are trying to paint, where he gets soaked while sleeping through a furious storm, dries out, is enveloped by the sun, charges down the mountain energized and more alive than ever, where he finds the artists worried, nervous, uncomfortable, but talking about the beautiful storm clouds they were trying to commit to canvas. \u201cI know,\u201d smiled Muir. \u201cI was there, in the midst of it\u201d (<a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"xref11\">Rothenberg, 2002<\/a>). A feeling he will never forget.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929138276400\">The visual is so much easier to speak about, but working with natural sound has many of the same pitfalls. Sometimes what most evokes the real is not the real. Every field recording is still a construction. How do the best nature sound recordists hone their craft? Lang Elliott wants to make you feel you are actually present in the midst of his soundscapes, and will do what it takes to make it happen. Gordon Hempton, in his pursuit of pure silence, makes you wish you weren\u2019t there and gives you a pang of sorrow when we realize nature can no longer escape our intrusions.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45929138276928\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Lang Elliott seeks the most beautiful sound<\/h3><p id=\"idm45929138277840\">Lang Elliott learned early on he had an ability to tell when a recording was good. He found this talent drew him deeper into the field than the need to answer questions with the scientific method. Like so many great lovers of nature, he never finished his dissertation. He had too much else to do. According to Elliott, nature sound recording should not be science fiction recording. \u201cI find my recordings, I don\u2019t construct them. I want to know they are the real thing.\u201d (<a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"xref3\">Elliott, 2016<\/a>) Starting out as a recordist for the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, collecting material for what is now called the Macaulay Library of Natural Sounds, Elliott was disappointed in the poor quality of so many of their recordings. When he found out that Cornell was more interested in comprehensivity and quantity, that is, trying to get recordings of every species out there even if the recordings didn\u2019t sound all that great, just checking each one off a master institutional life list, he struck out on his own, convinced that a living could be made with recordings of the highest quality.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929138278464\">But, like the wanderer in <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance<\/i>, (<a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"xref10\">Pirsig, 1974<\/a>) Elliott had to figure out just what quality means, never an easy task even if you go all the way back to Plato and Aristotle. Now, after 35 years on the job, he has a simple and clear answer: The recording that takes you <i>there<\/i>. The sound that truly brings you out into a wild and natural place. Unlike some recordists, he doesn\u2019t think these places are all that hard to find. \u201cThey are near to where we live, there is wildness, there is silence and peacefulness. Maybe it\u2019s not all that many minutes before a car goes by or an airplane flies overhead, but the sounds of nature are accessible. We need to capture them and present them so that more people will learn how to listen to and to value them.\u201d<\/p><p id=\"idm45929138281248\">Elliott favors a modified binaural approach, that is, stereo microphones fitted on a model human head that re-create the way we humans equipped with two symmetrical ears listen to the world. Many nature recordists swear by this contraption but it has always looked a bit extreme (<a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1<\/a>).<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F1\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/354ce302-bd28-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/molestias_eos_est_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/354ce302-bd28-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/molestias_eos_est_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/354ce302-bd28-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JEA-00009-2017-02_F0001.tif\" download=\"JEA-00009-2017-02_F0001.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 1 - A binaural head recording system.<\/p><div class=\"fig-description\"><i>By EJ Posselius. Available at this <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Georg_Neumann_Ku_100_Dummy_Head.jpg\" id=\"idm45929145105808\">link<\/a>. Reproduced under CC BY-SA 2.0 via Wikimedia Commons.<\/i><\/div><\/div><\/div><p id=\"idm45929138281744\">This technology has been around for decades but may not have been taken so seriously because people in general did not listen to music with headphones. But now most of us do, it is a method whose time may have at last arrived. Lang Elliott improved the standard binaural setup by using better microphones, and he has been carrying it around the world now for many years. So, his recordings work best when heard with good headphones, but the technique translates to stereo speakers as well.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929138281872\">Technology is one thing but attitude is another. For Lang, the key thing is a deep focus on sound. \u201cThe answer must lie in aesthetics,\u201d he smiles. Since a long-ago accident, Lang Elliott has not been able to hear any sound above 3,000 hertz. So, he misses most of what the birds and insects are singing! That hasn\u2019t stopped the development of his listening talent, maybe it has even improved it. He invented the first truly advanced hearing aid for birdwatchers, the SongFinder, (<a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"xref2\">Elliott, 2015<\/a>) that shifted the higher frequencies down in precise ways to enable the many birdwatchers who don\u2019t hear as well as they used to still be able to notice what\u2019s singing out there. Through years of practice, he\u2019s been able to compensate, to know what needs to be heard. A great composer of soundscape recordings listens to so much out there in the world, then has the ability to know what is worth bringing home.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929145022048\">\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to recognize the beauty of the hermit thrush,\u201d he explains. Flutelike, warbling, pentatonic or not pentatonic, no water and no rock, these are the kinds of the things writers have thought of about this wonderful bird. Most noticeable to me is that it is musical in a way that is not humanly musical, but musical all the same. We <i>get<\/i> it, in a way that much of the natural world we do not get.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929145021248\">Elliott doesn\u2019t want to talk or wonder about the bird\u2019s song, he wants to present it in as beautiful a way has he can. He needed to find in nature the right placement of the song, the instant composition. If the bird is the foreground, he needs a background. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like in Zen meditation, when you let that journey be your story, let the stories draw you in. Some people think the more you know, the deeper the experience, but too much knowledge can take you away from the place.\u201d<\/p><p id=\"idm45929145022176\">And a sound without a context is just a raw, technical example, a species name to file away on a list or a song to add to the names which you think you can pair with a sound. That\u2019s no way to put forth beauty. A perfect image of a bird on a white background might be good for identification purposes, but not for any understand of what life really is:<\/p><div class=\"blockquote\"><a id=\"idm45929145024048\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><p class=\"first\" id=\"idm45929145023232\">I was going out, looking for the artful recordings that often just had a handful of elements. Not the dawn chorus, which often has too much going on. I started working on the hermit thrush. The strongest recording turned out to be one morning after it had rained, I recorded a hermit thrush at dawn along with the dripping water from the rain. I love it. There are two elements, two sound objects, but on the other hand there is one focus sound object, the thrush singing in place with the drips, thousands and thousands of sound objects. They are spread out in space, it creates a three-dimension seed that is in itself interesting. Every so often the sparkle is happening with that thrush. I found it, it\u2019s the real thing. I wouldn\u2019t be impressed if someone created or constructed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/musicofnature.com\/hermit-thrush-drip\/\" id=\"idm45929145022432\">this<\/a>.<\/p><\/div><p id=\"idm45929145023488\">So many of Lang\u2019s most beautiful soundscape recordings make use of this simple aesthetic approach. Snowy tree crickets rhythms interplay above the gentle waves lapping the shores of Lake Ontario. Cricket frogs overlapping with pine sawyer beetles chewing rotting logs. So often there is an overlap of two main sounds in an Elliott recording, and even in his dawn chorus recordings, at these moments so often overwhelming with sounds in the height of spring, Elliott finds clarity and simplicity, a kind of chamber music dawn chorus in \u201cSummer Frogs,\u201d along with many of these <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/musicofnature.com\/listening-room\/\" id=\"idm45929145024416\">other soundscapes<\/a> I am describing. These recordings are simply brilliant, clear, and present, and listen to the competition, of which there is many, and these really are different.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929145024704\">He never constructs these soundscapes in the studio. He is not a purist, for he does sometimes use noise reduction, equalization, and some of the subtle editing tools of the modern audio production world. Most important for him is to find real natural moment that have a kind of balance, harmony, and clarity, and isolate these from the rest of the many hours of field recording. Like finding the best shots out of thousands of photographs, and to present them as real moments from the natural world. There are thousands of beautiful and immersive natural soundscapes and traverses that move through the arc of every day and night. Most of them are of course not recorded or noticed like all those trees that fall in the forests of our unremembered and undocumented world. Have we not recorded enough hermit thrush songs and frog choruses to satisfy anyone\u2019s curiosity? Of course not. There sure are many better photographers than sound recordists, and we still need to take more pictures because we always aim for a personal connection to the beauty and strangeness of the world (<a href=\"#F2\">Figure 2<\/a>).<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F2\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/354ce302-bd28-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/est_rerum_architecto_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/354ce302-bd28-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/est_rerum_architecto_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/354ce302-bd28-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JEA-00009-2017-02_F0002.tif\" download=\"JEA-00009-2017-02_F0002.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 2 - Lang Elliott at Dai Bosatsu Zendo, Livingston Manor, NY.<\/p><div class=\"fig-description\"><i>Photo by David Rothenberg.<\/i><\/div><\/div><\/div><p id=\"idm45929145065216\">Elliott is quite humble but does admit one thing: he has a knack for it. He somehow knows how to record beautiful sounds in nature and this led to his break from Cornell many years ago. They wanted quantity, he wanted quality. Hunting down quality without a big institution to back you up has been a difficult road to follow in terms of a career path, but there is no doubt to anyone who listens to them that Elliott is an artist in his chosen media of listening to world of environments as they present them to us.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929145086160\">In Elliott\u2019s magnificent recording of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/musicofnature.com\/bugling-of-the-elk\/\" id=\"idm45929145100032\">trumpeting<\/a> of a herd of elk in autumn heat, amazingly from Pennsylvania where there is just one elk reserve, we hear soloists vying for attention in the mix, the mammal world\u2019s possible answer to the parry of a park full of nightingales.

Though in Lang Elliott\u2019s elk recording one immediately hears the brilliance of Elliott\u2019s work, the careful quiet insect background, the perfect selection of a fragment of nature that is fabulously composed. As he describes it, he just has a knack, a talent further developed through decades of experience to simply pick out what moments of nature are most worth remembering.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929138436752\">The splendor of the singular, the allure of the whole. A soloist, a duet, a symphony or band. The magnificence of an individual or the convolution of the whole, these are different ways to form the musicality in a natural moment, something to seek out and then to capture in a recording to bring home so all of us can hear, and be transported, back to the source.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929138458368\">The transportation is the key for Elliott, the sound that makes us feel we are there. Not for any ethos, not for any comment on the state of the planet or a lament for human rapacity in the destruction and elimination of such moments, but the wondrous ability of sound to make us feel we are somewhere else, somewhere rare and beautiful, either far away or right around us but usually unnoticed:<\/p><div class=\"blockquote\"><a id=\"idm45929138468928\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><p class=\"first\" id=\"idm45929138474944\">There are different kinds of recordings. Close-up recordings of specific species, so loud and clean, these are impressive, but very quickly you tire of listening to it. There is not much that is <i>healing<\/i> here, you soon turn it down or turn it off, there are also recordings that are pitched as environmental that they have so much going on, they are a cacophonous barrage of too much, disturbing at some level, too much stuff going on. The kind I like is this third category where there are fewer elements, more tasteful, not cacophonous, that don\u2019t wangle your ear. They are engaging at some level but not the normal way, they are something you can sink into. They are zenlike, somehow healing. My Zen practice has certainly informed my recording practice (<a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"xref3\">Elliott, 2016<\/a>).<\/p><\/div><p id=\"idm45929139657232\">You may know what it is or have no idea at all, but sound can pull you right into its shape and form.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929138252768\">Bernie Krause has also lamented this, and has offered up before and after examples of a forest before selective cutting, and after selective cutting when the place even looks pretty good, but Krause points out, the sound has been compromised (<a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"xref8\">Krause, 2013<\/a>). It lacks the purity and richness and what he and Almo Farina have called the complexity in a soundscape.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929145032160\">Perhaps Krause\u2019s most poignant example is the lamenting cry of a beaver after his dam has been removed, a moan that touches us all deep inside once we hear the story behind it.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929145038384\">\u201cCome on,\u201d says Lang, \u201cthat\u2019s a good story Bernie but that\u2019s just what beavers sound like. You\u2019re using their emotion to make us all feel guilty.\u201d<\/p><p id=\"idm45929145044928\">Elliott, more interested in the perfect beauty of a recording that offers the balance between consistency and novelty that aesthetes have tried to pinpoint has the hallmark of great art, is less of an extremist. \u201cYou may find the swish of cars in the rain to be a beautiful sound, or the deep thrum of ships passing in the night. Hell, right whales love that sound, that\u2019s why they sometimes run into ships in the Boston Harbor. They seek out the noise.\u201d<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45929145051744\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Gordon Hempton fears for no silence<\/h3><p id=\"idm45929145059520\">Lang Elliott wants to transport us, Gordon Hempton wants fear\u2026 fear for the loss of the possibility of silence. His \u201cOne Square Inch of Silence\u201d project is particularly poignant because of its locality. Hempton has lived on the Olympic Peninsula for years, and although he has traveled the world in search of the most beautiful and pristine soundscapes, he takes pride in his local, one spot deep in the Ho Rainforest that he says is one of only 12 places in the entire continental United States where you could hear nature unmitigated for up to 15 minutes without hearing the intrusion of a human sound. That\u2019s how prevalent our noise encroachments have become, there really is no escape from the human scene.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929145065488\">\u201cI will never say that I\u2019m a good listener,\u201d said Gordon Hempton the Sound Tracker, another of the world\u2019s greatest field recordists. \u201cThinking that I was a good listener was one thing that kept me from being a good listener (<a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"xref5\">Hempton, 2016<\/a>).\u201d I am intrigued by his lifelong search for silence. He looks for inner silence, which he says is a reverence for life and the good that we carry wherever we go. But he also looks for outer silence, a naturally quiet place where human sounds do not intrude and this is something he can hardly find. Crisscrossing the whole United States, he has identified only twelve places where nature can resound without being interrupted by a human noise less than once every several minutes. When it comes to sound, there is no longer any nature that sings without us intruding on the mix.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929145083088\">John Muir a hundred and forty years ago listened everywhere he went in the mountains of the Sierras and beyond: \u201cThe profound bass of the naked branches and boles booming like waterfalls; the quick tense vibrations of the pine needles, now rising to a shrill, whistling hiss, now falling to a silky murmur, the rustling of laurel groves in the dells, and he keen metallic click of leaf and leaf\u2026 The air is music the wind forsakes. All things move in music and write it\u201d (<a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"xref4\">Hempton, 2009<\/a>). Muir wrote all these lines in the age before sound could be recorded, we needed such words to believe that the Earth as a whole is at least a musical Being. Muir heard sound as one more piece of evidence of the beauty nature calls out if not for us then at least to us, ready for our attention and reverence. For Hempton more than a century later, silence is both a practical and a spiritual goal, it is the principle that guides all his work and his message.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929145098528\">By his two kinds of silences he never means no sound, just no unwanted sound, and no mindless machine-made human sound, the noise that we cannot escape. Yet more than his ethos his life journey and choices are what intrigues me most about Hempton. He was engaged for a deaf woman for several years\u2014did he find in her someone who was at peace with silence? He has chosen to live as close as he can to the quietest of all American National Parks, the Olympic, with its Ho Rainforest where Hempton has identified his own personal shrine, the one square inch of silence where finally the encroachments of Noisy Man can be fought off. His recordings are astonishingly beautiful and precise, clearly composed and constructed, yet he claims he does not edit them. Why does he try to say that when they are so clearly works of art and not documents of nature? I do not know\u2014but it may be akin to those photographers who use Photoshop to correct color but would never move an object into an image that was never originally there.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929145103696\">I am wrenched by the tragedy that Hempton lost his hearing not once but twice, and am inspired by the fact that he is partially able to hear again but now cannot make such exemplary nature sound recordings without the help of someone whose ears are more clear. Seeking silence, he has been given silence, but will not rest because that silence does not really exist in the actual out there world. We still must reckon with the omnipresence of noise (<a href=\"#F4\">Figure 4<\/a>).<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F4\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/354ce302-bd28-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/animi_corporis_porro_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/354ce302-bd28-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/animi_corporis_porro_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/354ce302-bd28-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JEA-00009-2017-02_F0004.tif\" download=\"JEA-00009-2017-02_F0004.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 4 - Gordon Hempton and binaural recording system.<\/p><div class=\"fig-description\"><i>Photo courtesy of Gordon Hempton.

I can see why Hempton elected to publish it himself, this way he could do everything exactly the way he wanted, color photos, links to online audio material, no publisher telling him what he could or could not do. Unlike his previous memoiristic <i>One Square Inch of Silence<\/i>, this recent tome is basically a how-to manual for working with environmental sound, aimed at acousmatic composers and especially professional sound designers for games, podcasts and films.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929138417472\">His most interesting chapter is one on how to record what Hempton calls <i>quietudes<\/i>: natural ambiences at the very lower limit of human hearing, soundscapes that are almost silent but not actually silent, the real, beautiful quiet that is so close to silence but not empty like an engineer\u2019s anechoic chamber so immortalized by John Cage.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929138480016\">Hempton is famous for saying that there are really only 12 truly quiet places in America (and absolutely none in Europe), where one could go just 15 minutes without hearing a human interrupting sound. One is the bottom of the Haleakala Crater on the busy island of Maui. Go ten thousand feet up and then walk one thousand feet down, you are in the middle of a strange tropical desert. He calls it the quietest place on Earth, where the sound level \u201cmeasures in negative decibels and feels absolutely silent at first listen, but when amplified just 20\u00a0dBA we can actually hear the mantra-like beating of Pacific sound waves lapping over the 10,000-foot high rim of the volcano.\u201d Such barely vibrating soundscapes are quite tricky to capture:<\/p><div class=\"blockquote\"><a id=\"idm45929144932976\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><p class=\"first\" id=\"idm45929145133712\">Once I\u2019ve chosen a location I commonly experience the thought: \u201cNothing is happening.\u201d I\u2019ve learned that this once-disappointing observation is actually great news\u2026 Early one morning from where I sat, headphones on, the whole world was asleep. Listening to my recording now, my eyes have filled with tears as I recall that glorious morning and the revelation of how peaceful a natural place can sound in sustained anticipation of the rising sun. It is the presence of everything. Quiet is profoundly quieting (<a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"xref7\">Knight, 2015<\/a>).<\/p><\/div><p id=\"idm45929145044128\">Humanity may have no place in the Ho Rainforest, as any move we make threatens to turn the one square inch of silence down to a centimeter or less. Nature in its perfection certainly needs us not. And yet we are here, threatening to ruin everything. Instead I would like to find glimpses of hope where nature shines in the midst of human noises.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929145055984\">Listen to Gordon Hempton\u2019s wonderful track composed out of sounds from his favorite soundscape in all the world, a piece that accompanies his book <i>One Square Inch of Silence<\/i>, which refers to an exact <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.soundtracker.com\/products\/one-square-inch-silence\/\" id=\"idm45929145096800\">place<\/a>, which is a few miles off the trail in the Olympic National Park (<a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"xref4\">Hempton, 2009<\/a>). As I said above, it is clearly a composition, carefully assembled out of his favorite sounds in his realm. It begins with howling coyotes! Is that natural or artificial reverb surrounding those melismas? Certainly, sounds carefully crafted, something positive to me not something anti-original or pure. Then comes a beautiful rhythm of raindrops on leaves, coolly cyclical, an easy beat to sample and work with like those loops on repeat out of clicking whales and footsteps that always tempt us hunters for rhythm out there in the world. The piece is a series of solaces, silent spaces in between the offerings, like individual songs of nightingales with space or response or reflection in between.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929145038912\">Silences, inner or outer, what are they really? Certainly, not absences of sound but spaces in the mind, moments to reflect within. No one who has been inside anechoic chambers, artificial rooms that have absolutely no sound or resonance, is happy with the experience. John Cage spoke of the experience most positively, saying he heard the whirr of his brain and the beat of his heart, which has become the account of legend. Others feel queasiness, some sense of sonic space to be missing. For better or worse, we cannot stomach true silence. We are at home in noise, the booming, buzzing confusion that William James defined as the stream of consciousness that keeps us alive.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45929145039552\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Can our sound ever possibly fit in?<\/h3><p id=\"idm45929145041200\">We have all heard that human beings too are a part of nature. Then why do we make so much noise? Why does it seems so easy for us to ruin it all?<\/p><p id=\"idm45929145046272\">Attentiveness to the soundscape will make most people begin to investigate and to be annoyed by the noise. Hempton\u2019s reverence for pure sound quickly makes the goal of his sonography to be something rare and wondrous. But once again it is like a fabulous nature photograph. We <i>feel<\/i> as if we are in the middle of nowhere but can never be sure.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929145050384\">A few years ago, I took a trip to the Arctic aboard a schooner packed with artists and scientist, and the captain told us, \u201cyou are all so fortunate, we are about to visit a situation that is extremely rare. A group of polar bears all eating the carcass of a dead whale, they\u2019ve been picking it clean for months.\u201d We were so excited. Everyone took photos, videos, notes, sketches, and started making plans to turn it into art. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xNnb0RKgBGc\" id=\"idm45929145051344\">This<\/a> is what I did with it (<a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"xref12\">Rothenberg and Peerna, 2010<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm45929145057152\">We did kind of wonder\u2026 <i>how<\/i> did the captain know exactly where we would find this pungent, decomposing whale? Back in civilization, it was easy to find hundreds of pictures of this very same scene, snapped by every possible Svalbard tourist that season! In some of the pictures the polar bears were reaching up to the gunwales and sniffing the photographers! I even saw the same photo in <i>National Geographic<\/i>, with a gripping caption explaining how rare this situation was, how long and hard their photographer searched for the right place\u2026 Why must we lie about the common sights and sounds in nature and imagine they are rare and unusual?<\/p><p id=\"idm45929145064080\">I don\u2019t want to trivialize this polar bear encounter by laughing at the kind of stories we tell. It was still so beautiful.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929145065712\">We are never quite comfortable claiming to rhapsodize or understanding nature. We still want nature to be more special than it ever can be\u2014Nature, so impossible to represent in art. This is why <i>Grizzly Man<\/i> is my favorite nature film, where Werner Herzog admits that Timothy Treadwell, a man so obsessed with bears that he ends up letting himself be eaten by one, with his closeness to his subject, captured far better footage than Herzog, master filmmaker and philosopher of the abyss, could ever get with his probing, humorous, and obsessive demeanor and commitment (<a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"xref6\">Herzog, 2005<\/a>). Yet, the film Treadwell would have made, had he survived, would have been terrible. He had <i>access<\/i> to the best material, but he did not understand art, or the depths the human spirit is capable of. The world is lucky that Herzog got a hold of that material and decided to make the film. It shows the ultimate folly of humans claiming they can understand anything about the world of animals or the way they perceive the world. We are always only ourselves.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929145078960\">In the most moving scene in <i>Grizzly Man<\/i>, Werner Herzog listens to the final audio recording of the grizzly bear eating Timothy Treadwell alive. You see his solemn expression as he silently hears the terrible screams. \u201cNo one,\u201d he announces to us from the screen, \u201cshould ever hear this tape. It must be destroyed.\u201d If nature is as terrible and dangerous as we fear, this ultimate terror should never be repeated for our entertainment. It is a deeper truth than that.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929145084256\">You cannot forget all the art you have seen or have heard as you strive to make your own. Study the masters in all these media, try to learn their methods and retrace their steps. It is all right if many have traced these steps before. We are only as original as our history. Take everything in and you will learn how to fit in, as a human animal in nature, and as an artist in the world of art. It\u2019s the same for image as it is for sound.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929145090560\">I wonder these things as I walk from my house down the steep autumn street to the river, this is far from the best time of year for bird song but still so much music is in the air. The mockingbird refuses to burst into song when the weather is this cold but he lets out a deep <i>shoomph<\/i> as I walk by, either a gruff \u201chey you\u201d or a quick warning for me to watch out, that I\u2019ll never know much about his music or that of any bird. Trees full of starlings alight into miasmic murmurations that swoop through the sky against the red golden trees. The final crickets of the year try their last fall singing before the first frost will kill them unless they sneak into our houses to serenade us and eke out a few more weeks of life. Dead leaves are whipped up by the wind into a percussive swish, like an exotic Zildjian still not designed in the family of cymbals. Nothing rare here, but it all can be beautiful if one wants it to and truly follows each emergent sonic form.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929145094832\">And these are just the inhuman sounds I have chosen to notice. The noises of our species can also transfix us, for technology has always been best if it too admits the possibility of beauty. The thrum of a braking midnight train vibrates the Earth like the crashing ninepins of Rip Van Winkle\u2019s dream, that thundering trance that happened just up the river a few miles from here. Great oil barges humming up the Hudson, on their own or amazingly pushed by tiny powerful tugboats. The waves these vessels make can surprise you, mini-tsunamis on the beach that might wash all your clothes into the drink while you\u2019re taking a swim.<\/p><p id=\"idm45929145097456\">These are the kind of sounds that truly grab our attention, whether or not, we admit them in as music. They are intractable mysteries, and we don\u2019t forget them. The contemplation of beauty at the juncture of the natural and the human benefits from utter directness, and at the same time can be enhanced as data. We are constantly reminded that all our questions and our movements generate information, if we don\u2019t attend to it some corporation or government will collect it all from us and draw their own conclusions. As go our own singular trajectories, so unique but maybe not all that different from everyone else\u2019s, the slight deviations in information might just tell us what makes us who we are.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div id=\"article-back\" class=\"back\"><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45929145106768\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Competing interests<\/h3><p id=\"idm45929145110192\">David Rothenberg declares that he has no conflict of interest.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"back-section\"><a id=\"idm45929145098896\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Acknowledgements<\/h3><p id=\"idm45929145103424\">David Rothenberg thanks the Journal of Ecoacoustics for agreeing to publish this less academic, more essayistic piece and for recognizing that more artistic approaches to ecoacoustics have a place in this journal.<\/p><\/div><h3 class=\"main-title\">Funding sources<\/h3><p>None.<\/p><div class=\"back-section\"><h3 class=\"main-title\">References<\/h3><div class=\"reference-container\" id=\"fn1\"><div><div class=\"ref-content\"><strong>Diderot D.<\/strong> (1995).

This is because the size of the 3D corner separation sets the compressors off-design performance and blockage and therefore it\u2019s operating range. The aim of this paper is to determine how two types of modelling fidelities limit the accuracy of the prediction of 3D corner separations. The first modelling fidelity is the accuracy with which the flow within a blade passage is modelled (endwall geometry modelling, shroud modelling and the boundary layer transition modelling). The second modelling fidelity is the accuracy of modelling in the multi-blade row environment (multi-stage repeating stage boundary layer modelling and the local skew endwall boundary layer modelling). The first part of the paper shows that when the compressor studied has its original \u201cdesign intent\u201d geometry (defined as 1% shroud clearance and a hydraulically smooth blade surface) the size of the 3D corner separation is relatively insensitive to the modelling fidelities within the blade row but is highly sensitive to modelling fidelity in the multi-blade row environment. This explains the inability of 3D CFD to predict multistage matching. The second part of the paper shows that when the compressor has its \u201cend of life\u201d geometry (defined as 3% shroud clearance and surface roughness measured from an engine blade at 4,000 cycles) the size of the 3D corner separation suddenly becomes highly sensitivity to modelling fidelities within an individual blade row. This finding is of significant importance to designers because it shows that current computational codes are not able to predict end of life performance.<\/p><\/div>\n",

This is important because the 3D corner separation often controls the operating incidence range of the blade row. Two types of modelling fidelity are investigated: (i) the modelling fidelity within the blade row itself and (ii) the modelling fidelity in the multi-blade row environment.<\/p><p id=\"idm45718109620336\">The modelling fidelity within the blade row is investigated in two ways: First, the effect of the fidelity with which the endwall and shroud cavity geometry is modelled is investigated. Second, the effect of transition modelling is investigated. These two effects are labelled in <a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F1\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/491c2ad0-04aa-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/facilis_qui_quis_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/491c2ad0-04aa-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/facilis_qui_quis_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/491c2ad0-04aa-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JGPPS-00038-2018-01_F0001.tif\" download=\"JGPPS-00038-2018-01_F0001.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 1 - The physical mechanisms studied in this paper.<\/p><\/div><\/div><p id=\"idm45718109636016\">The modelling fidelity in the multi-blade row environment is also investigated in two ways: First the effect of the inlet endwall boundary layer skew close to the annulus endwall (0\u20135% span), due to change in frame of reference, is investigated. Second, the effect of the endwall annulus boundary layer, developed in a multi-stage compressor (5\u201340% span) is investigated. These two effects are labelled in <a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1<\/a>.<\/p><p id=\"idm45718109651808\">The compressor stage geometry used in this paper is characteristic of a modern 3D shrouded compressor in the rear stages of a high pressure compressor. The aim of the paper is not to investigate the sensitivity of 3D corner separations to blade design and so the geometry of the baseline blade will be held constant throughout the study.<\/p><p id=\"idm45718110201936\">The sensitivity of modelling fidelity within a blade row has already been reported in the literature (<a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"xref4\">Gbadebo et al., 2004<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"xref5\">Goodhand and Miller, 2012<\/a>). Goodhand and Miller showed that the 3D corner separation is most sensitive to the state of the compressor suction surface boundary layer, close to the endwall. The work shows that the 3D corner separation size is very sensitive to transition on the early suction surface. Gbadebo et al. showed that the 3D corner separation is also very sensitive to roughness on the leading edge and early suction surface. The two papers were undertaken on a 2D blade design and therefore may not be representative of a modern 3D blade. It is, however, clear that corner separations are highly sensitive to transition and roughness on the early suction surface.<\/p><p id=\"idm45718109570704\">The sensitivity of modelling fidelity in the multi-blade row environment has also been reported in the literature (<a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"xref1\">Auchoybur and Miller, 2016<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"xref11\">Taylor and Miller, 2016<\/a>). Taylor and Miller showed that 2D compressor blades are very sensitive to small changes in the inlet profile to the stage. These small changes were not only found to cause the separation size to change but also caused its location to switch between the casing and hub wall. Auchoybur and Miller found that even in 3D compressor blades the corner separation is largely controlled by the inlet endwall annulus boundary layer, developed in a multi-stage compressor (5\u201340% span). The sensitivity of the 3D corner separation to the multi-stage endwall boundary layer explains why Reynolds-averaged Navier\u2013Stokes (RANS) codes are often inaccurate at predicting multi-stage compressor matching.<\/p><p id=\"idm45718109595008\">The paper is split into two parts. In the first part, the sensitivity study is undertaken with a compressor that has the design intent geometry. This has been defined as a shroud clearance of 1% span and blade surfaces that are hydraulically smooth. In the second part of the paper, the sensitivity study is undertaken with a compressor that has an \u201cend of life\u201d geometry. This has been defined as a shroud clearance of 3% span and blade surface roughness scaled from engines after 4,000 take-off and landing cycles. The effect of blade geometry changes over life, other than roughness, have not been considered.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45718109607568\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Methodology<\/h3><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45718109619536\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Experimental<\/h4><p id=\"idm45718109654432\">The SMURF rig (<a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"xref6\">Kanjirakkad et al., 2010<\/a>) in the Whittle Laboratory, shown in <a href=\"#F2\">Figure 2<\/a>, has been used to conduct the sensitivity studies in this paper. The SMURF rig is a low-speed multi-stage compressor, representative of a modern high pressure compressor. Each stage has identical geometry, with shrouded stator hub endwalls. For use in this paper, experimental data has been collected from a 1% span shroud clearance build of the rig and a 3% span clearance build. The rotor tip gap for each stage is 1.75% span. The average stage Reynolds number is ~5 \u00d7 10<sup>5<\/sup> based on chord, with blade aspect ratios of ~1 and stage reaction based on mid-span of 65%. The stage has been designed at a moderate flow and work coefficient, and contains 3D blading.<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F2\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/491c2ad0-04aa-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/autem_debitis_autem_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/491c2ad0-04aa-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/autem_debitis_autem_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/491c2ad0-04aa-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JGPPS-00038-2018-01_F0002.tif\" download=\"JGPPS-00038-2018-01_F0002.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 2 - SMURF multistage low speed compressor.<\/p><\/div><\/div><p id=\"idm45718109568432\">A five-hole probe, with a 2.5\u00a0mm head diameter was used to traverse downstream of stator 2.

The computational results are all from simulations using Menter\u2019s k-\u03c9 SST turbulence model (<a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"xref7\">Menter, 1992<\/a>) as it gave more accurate results that the Spalart-Allmaras model. Nonetheless, similar trends in the results were observed for both models. PADRAM (<a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"xref10\">Shahpar and Lapworth, 2003<\/a>) was used to generate the mesh, which was configured to provide a multi-block structured O-H grid topology throughout the domain with a y+ ~1 on all viscous surfaces. Shroud cavity wells are modelled using a stub cavity model and a knife-to-knife (k2k) cavity model which is based on an experimental study in the literature (<a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"xref12\">Wellborn et al., 2000<\/a>). The k2k model, which has been calibrated against rig test data, was found give more accurate results than fully meshing the cavities.<\/p><p id=\"idm45718109609536\">The computational studies in this paper are all performed on the embedded stator 2 of the SMURF rig. The operating point investigated in all of the sections corresponds to an off-design operating point, <i>\u03c6<\/i> = 0.47 and <i>\u03c8<\/i> = 0.51.

This transition location is specified between 5 to 95% span.<\/p><p id=\"idm45718109623152\">In the experiment, the effect of roughness typical of an end of life blade was modelled using the sand grain technique reported in the literature (<a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"xref5\">Goodhand and Miller, 2012<\/a>). The sand grain size was scaled to match the roughness Reynolds number of a real engine stator blade exposed to approximately 4,000 cycles, which was shown in the literature (<a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"xref2\">Brendel et al., 2008<\/a>) to increase to around 34, with a roughness height of 2\u00a0<i>\u03bc<\/i>m.

Naylor performed hot-wire traverses downstream of a stator blade row and showed that the incoming rotor wakes only had a small effect on the size of the 3D separation. Similar insight is also gleaned from Goodhand and Miller who showed that by triggering a large 3D separation with a movable leading edge trip, the timescale of the growth of the separation is an order of magnitude larger than the blade passing frequency.<\/p><p id=\"idm45718109591376\">It should be noted that even two blade rows into a multistage CFD solution, the small errors shown in <a href=\"#F4\">Figure 4<\/a> start to accumulate and large errors can occur.

The design intent geometry is defined as a shroud clearance of 1% span and blade surfaces that are hydraulically smooth. The sensitivity analysis was undertaken using the embedded stage model. The model was run at the off-design operating point, as defined in the methodology section.<\/p><p id=\"idm45718109627120\">The first two sections will describe the sensitivity of the 3D corner separation to modelling fidelity in the blade passage alone.

Loss is not a good metric as clearly turning on and off a particular physical mechanism will eliminate a particular loss mechanism but will not necessarily alter the size of 3D corner separations. The metric chosen focuses on the hub called the \u201chub corner separation fraction,\u201d which is defined in <a href=\"#F5\">Figure 5<\/a>.

The second finding is that the loss contours downstream of the trailing edge are nearly identical for the first three cases but slightly lower in magnitude in the fourth case. The lower value in the fourth case is simply due to the loss generated on the stator endwall being removed.<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F6\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/491c2ad0-04aa-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/perspiciatis_et_sed_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/491c2ad0-04aa-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/perspiciatis_et_sed_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/491c2ad0-04aa-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JGPPS-00038-2018-01_F0006.tif\" download=\"JGPPS-00038-2018-01_F0006.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 6 - Sensitivity to endwall and shroud modelling fidelity for the \u201cdesign intent\u201d geometry.<\/p><\/div><\/div><p id=\"idm45718109612992\">The results show that for a modern 3D compressor stator the topology of the 3D corner separation is not very sensitive to the local blade modelling fidelity of the endwall and shroud.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45718109612192\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Sensitivity to transition modelling<\/h4><p id=\"idm45718109653728\">Two cases were undertaken: a fully turbulent case and an imposed transition case, where point transition is imposed along a spanwise line on the blade surface, based on MISES 2D calculations of individual sections.

The fully turbulent case however shows separation across the whole span, with the \u201chub corner separation fraction\u201d increasing by 8 percentage points. The experimental flow visualisation agrees closely with the case where transition is modelled, as shown by the suction surface boundary layer similarly not separated at the trailing edge over a small portion of the span (60\u201370% span). The downstream loss contours show that the change in separation size has changed the size of the downstream loss contours.<\/p><p id=\"idm45718109645392\">The sensitivity to transition modelling, though significant, is much smaller than the effect reported on 2D compressor blades in the literature (<a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"xref5\">Goodhand and Miller, 2012<\/a>). This implies that though transition modelling is important, its importance on 3D blades is much weaker than in 2D blades.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45718109560704\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Sensitivity to modelling in the multi-stage environment<\/h4><p id=\"idm45718109618960\">The way in which the multi-stage environment communicates with the 3D corner separation in a particular blade row is through the blade inlet profile. The inlet profile develops over multiple stages and is notoriously difficult to predict using RANS CFD. The result is that many gas turbine manufacturers predict stage matching using low order methods tuned to experimental levels of blockage, deviation and loss.<\/p><p id=\"idm45718109618080\">The aim of this section is to investigate the sensitivity of the 3D corner separation to errors in different regions of a blade\u2019s inlet profile. The measured \u201crepeating stage\u201d inlet profile to the stator is shown in red in <a href=\"#F8\">Figure 8<\/a>. The profile is made up of three regions. From 40\u201360% span, the freestream region, the profile is close to that of the design intent. From 5\u201340% and 60\u2013100% span, the profile is dominated by the \u201crepeating stage\u201d endwall boundary layers. These are the regions that develop over multiple blade rows and are difficult to predict accurately with RANS CFD. From 0\u20135% span, very close to the hub endwall, the profile is dominated by the highly skewed boundary layer caused by the change in frame of reference of the upstream rotor hub platform boundary layer. The blue inlet profile in <a href=\"#F8\">Figure 8<\/a> has the radial profile from 5\u201340% and 60\u2013100% replaced with a scaled \u201cdesign intent\u201d profile.

Comparing the LHS and centre of <a href=\"#F9\">Figure 9<\/a> shows that there has been a dramatic reduction in the \u201chub corner separation fraction\u201d of 13 percentage points.

The study clearly shows that for a modern 3D compressor blade, with the \u201cdesign intent\u201d geometry, the size of the 3D corner separations was only a weakly sensitive to the modelling fidelity within the blade row. However, the size of the 3D corner separations was strongly sensitive to the modelling fidelity within the multi-stage environment. Of course, multi-stage modelling fidelity also derives from the cumulative sum of the modelling fidelity within individual blade passages, however, it is the effect of inaccuracies built up over several blade rows which is important and not the modelling accuracy in the particular blade row being studied.<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F10\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/491c2ad0-04aa-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/ut_dolor_sit_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/491c2ad0-04aa-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/ut_dolor_sit_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/491c2ad0-04aa-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JGPPS-00038-2018-01_F0010.tif\" download=\"JGPPS-00038-2018-01_F0010.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 10 - Effect of modelling on hub corner separation fraction for \u201cdesign intent geometry.\u201d<\/p><\/div><\/div><p id=\"idm45718109630848\">This explains why many gas turbine manufacturers develop complex low order models tuned to experimental levels of blockage, deviation and loss. These models are used to predict radial profiles which are then fed into \u201cembedded stage\u201d CFD models such as the one described in this paper.<\/p><p id=\"idm45718109630096\">This work also explains why the findings on multi-stage endwall design in the literature (<a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"xref1\">Auchoybur and Miller, 2016<\/a>) were so powerful. The authors showed that to really influence a design you need to design in the multi-stage environment, exploiting the inlet profile sensitivity identified in this study. However, this presents the designer with a dilemma. The designer must use low order models to predict the multi-stage matching accurately, but those low-order methods prevent the designer exploiting the true power of sensitivity to multi-stage design. Developing new compressor design systems that exploit this sensitivity whilst accurately predicting multi-stage matching will be one of the most important challenges facing compressor designers.<\/p><p id=\"idm45718109575856\">One further point is worth making. The study described above is for a shrouded stator. A similar study has been undertaken for a rotor. Despite the suction surface flow topology being very different to the stator, the same conclusions can be drawn as shown in Appendix A. The 3D separation is shown to be insensitive to local changes in endwall modelling and again, only the inter-blade row profile has any significant influence.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45718109552240\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Part II: End of life geometry<\/h3><p id=\"idm45718109551632\">In this part of the paper, the sensitivity study is undertaken on a blade row with \u201cend of life\u201d geometry. This has been defined as a shroud clearance of 3% span and blade surface roughness scaled from an engine after 4,000 take-off and landing cycles. The sensitivity analysis was undertaken using a combination of the embedded stage model and experimentation. The sensitivity to endwall and shroud modelling was undertaken computationally. The sensitivity to \u201cend of life\u201d roughness was undertaken experimentally. This is because it was thought that the computational roughness models available to the authors would be unlikely to capture the real effect of roughness.<\/p><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45718110196624\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Sensitivity to endwall and shroud modelling<\/h4><p id=\"idm45718110196016\">The four endwall and shroud modelling methods were again used but this time the clearance on the shroud was raised to 3% of span.

The was done because in the computational endwall and shroud sensitivity studies earlier in the paper, it was found that making the endwall inviscid had relatively little effect on size of the hub corner separation. In this case, the opposite is done and the endwall is made extremely rough. Once again, it can be seen from <a href=\"#F15\">Figure 15<\/a> that changes to the endwall have little effect on the size of the corner separation.<\/p><p id=\"idm45718110225408\">The second case has 5\u201395% span roughness located on leading edges of the two removable stators (2% chord along pressure surface, around the leading edge to 5% chord along the suction surface). The aim of this test was to investigate the effect of large levels of leading edge roughness on the 3D corner separation. Work in the literature (<a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"xref4\">Gbadebo et al., 2004<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"xref5\">Goodhand and Miller, 2012<\/a>), showed that on 2D compressor blades 3D corner separation are extremely sensitive to leading edge roughness. <a href=\"#F15\">Figure 15<\/a> shows that the effect of roughness on the 3D compressor blade in this study was extremely large, larger than the effects reported in the literature (<a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"xref4\">Gbadebo et al., 2004<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"xref5\">Goodhand and Miller, 2012<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm45718110187616\">The high sensitivity of the blade to leading edge roughness in the current study is very surprising. Previous tests which exhibited sensitivity (<a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"xref4\">Gbadebo et al., 2004<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"xref5\">Goodhand and Miller, 2012<\/a>) were undertaken on two dimensional compressors blades which were designed without lean or sweep. In such blades, leading edge roughness \u201cweakens\u201d the blade surface boundary layer and results in a significant rise in the size of the 3D corner separation.<\/p><p id=\"idm45718110105136\">The design of the lean and sweep on the current blade was undertaken by \u201cbalancing\u201d the two aerodynamic failure mechanisms (3D corner separation and trailing edge separation). This method of 3D design is described in the literature (<a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"xref11\">Taylor and Miller, 2016<\/a>). Such a design is normally very insensitive to leading edge roughness. However, <a href=\"#F15\">Figure 15<\/a> shows that above a critical roughness the \u201cbalance\u201d design approach results in the boundary layer separating, \u201cunzipping\u201d across the whole span.<\/p><p id=\"idm45718110102144\">This finding is important because it shows that whilst 3D blades are more resistant to leading edge transition and roughness, once the leading edge roughness reaches a critical value the blade suffers from a catastrophic aerodynamic failure across the whole span.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45718110101104\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Conclusions<\/h3><p id=\"idm45718110100464\">The most important result in this paper is the switch in accuracy of computational codes as the compressor geometry changes from its \u201cdesign intent\u201d to its \u201cend of life\u201d geometry.<\/p><p id=\"idm45718110099808\">When a compressor has the \u201cdesign intent\u201d geometry, the computation accurately predicts the 3D corner separation size in a blade passage, on condition that the inlet flow to the blade passage is accurately known. However, computational codes typically fail to accurately predict 3D corner separations in multi-stage simulations and hence stage matching. In such simulations, small errors in the exit flow conditions from one blade row result in small errors in the inlet conditions to downstream blade rows. It is therefore the sensitivity of blades to small variations in inlet flow conditions, as shown in this paper, which causes the well-known problem of computational codes failing to accurately predict multi-stage matching.<\/p><p id=\"idm45718110098608\">When a compressor has its \u201cend of life\u201d geometry the accuracy of the computation switches. Even if a blade\u2019s inlet flow is accurately known the computation loses its ability to accurately predict the 3D corner separation size within a passage. This finding is of significant importance to designers because it shows that current computational codes are not able to predict end of life performance.<\/p><p id=\"idm45718110097744\">The sudden inaccuracy of computational codes to predict the 3D corner separations accurately within a single blade passage is found to have two causes. First, the effect of leakage seems to become progressively more important as the gap opens. Second, the effect of roughness becomes very important and should be of extreme concern to designers. Modern 3D blades are designed to \u201cbalance\u201d the aerodynamic failure mechanisms across the blade span (<a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"xref11\">Taylor and Miller, 2016<\/a>). This research shows that such a design philosophy is exceptionally good at making blades aerodynamic robust to low levels of leading edge roughness. However, above a critical level of leading edge roughness this style of blade \u201cunzips\u201d up the whole span causing catastrophic aerodynamic failure. Gas turbine manufacturers that do not have a tolerancing metric for this critical level of roughness are running a significant risk.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45718110095168\"><!--

It is demonstrated that as a direct result of the dynastic connection, Britain and Hanover maintained this highly important intelligence alliance throughout the 18th century, with tentacles into Sweden. In spite of intelligence being tainted by its reputation as \u201cdirty work\u201d at the time, in his various government positions, Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle (1693\u20131768), excelled in putting it to good use, especially to keep the Jacobites in Britain \u2014 supporters of the Stuart dynasty, who had been deposed in 1688 \u2014 and their French allies at bay.<\/p><\/div>\n",

This is surprising because Britain\u2019s\n        involvement in European affairs was considerable after 1714, when George I became the first Hanoverian king of\n        the united Great Britain and Ireland. However, one should remember that there was a tendency among the\n        aristocracy and gentry not only of Britain but also of the whole of Europe and America to view intelligence as a\n        dirty job well into the 20th century. An unspecified ambassador was said to have written in 1785 to the British\n        Secretary of State with respect to this unsavoury aspect: \u201cI abhor this dirty work, but when one is employed to\n        sweep chimneys, one must black one\u2019s fingers.\u201d<sup id=\"xref1\"><a href=\"#fn1\">1<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n    <p id=\"idm45643879080480\">Be that as it may, this attitude did not prevent the imminent Whig politician Thomas\n        Pelham-Holles \u2014 1<sup>st<\/sup> Duke of Newcastle, Secretary of State from 1724 to 1754, and British Prime\n        Minister from 1754 to 1756 \u2014 from dedicating himself to its arts. His private papers, extending to some 300\n        volumes now in the British Library in London, offer a vast mine of fascinating material, with no less than a\n        third dedicated to the intelligence information thereby gleaned.<\/p>\n\n    <p id=\"idm45643879080608\">The Jacobites, the ousted rival dynastic house to the Hanoverians, and their French\n        supporters were the principal focus of his intelligence attentions. To this end, he made use, above all, of\n        bribery (of both high and low) as well as of the employment of secret agents, ciphers, and \u201cinvisible\u201d writing.\n        Urine, in particular, was useful as it becomes visible only upon heating, but lemon juice also served the\n        purpose.<\/p>\n\n    <p id=\"idm45643879092880\">As a result of his endeavours, he penetrated the Jacobites, who threatened the overthrow\n        of the House of Hannover, through the use of \u201cPickle the Spy\u201d (otherwise known as Alistair Ruadh MacDonald) and\n        the Rotterdam merchant Richard Walters. In England, he was aided by the Hanoverian John Ernest Bode, as he was\n        known in his adopted country, noted for his ability to forge seals on behalf of the Secret Office from 1732.\n        Interestingly, his descendants carried on his work for their adopted country for more than a century, until\n        1844, by which time Hanover had gone its own way as the ascent of Queen Victoria to the throne was not permitted\n        by the Sallic law which reigned there. One native born Englishman also provided much assistance in this case. He\n        was, on the surface of it, a most unlikely candidate: Edward Willes, the future Bishop of Bath and Wells. He and\n        his family played a significant role in the long-established Deciphering Office, which continued its function\n        until 1844, scrutinising and deciphering, in particular, diplomatic correspondence, which is now found to be in\n        the Public Record Office.<\/p>\n\n    <p id=\"idm45643879110192\">Then as now, all the major European countries took similar measures and expected the like\n        of their counterparts. Therefore, the deliberate dispensation of misinformation also played a major role in\n        intelligence activities. Not surprisingly, because the King of England was also the Elector of Hanover,\n        intelligence activities were carried out, in particular, at intelligence headquarters in Nienburg. Thus, this\n        was the second special relationship \u2013 that is SIGNIT, (signals intelligence) alliance \u2013 between Britain and\n        another country, the first being with the House of Orange, in Holland, in the late 16<sup>th<\/sup> century, and\n        the third one in our own time, since the Second World War, with the United States. As of now, mutual trust was\n        sometimes in short supply: it would seem, for example, that in the late 18th century, the Prince Regent (later\n        George IV) did not reveal to his British ministers all the information that he was provided from the\n        interceptors and decipherers in Hanover. They, therefore, commissioned their own interceptions and decryptions,\n        a practice that continued until the death of the next and final Hanoverian king of Britain and Ireland, William\n        IV.<\/p>\n\n    <p id=\"idm45643879145760\">Newcastle\u2019s correspondence confirm that France was the ultimate focus of his concern \u2014\n        supporting, as it did, the Jacobite pretensions to the British throne \u2014 and that it was necessary to get the\n        support of its allies. This was, of course, the time of the War of the Austrian Succession which involved many\n        European powers, each with their own agenda. On 17 September 1741, Andrew Stone wrote on behalf of the Duke of\n        Newcastle to the Duke of Richmond \u2014 his close confident at court \u2014 on this matter, stating,<\/p>\n\n    <div class=\"blockquote\"><a id=\"idm45643879166832\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a>\n\n        <p class=\"first\" id=\"idm45643879180704\">There is nothing particular with regard to the progress of the French\n            Armies in Germany. The last letters from Hanover, dated about ten days ago, say that Mr Maillebois (a\n            marquis and marshall in the French army who conquered Corsica in 1739) if He continued his March, might be\n            upon the Frontiers of that Country in about three weeks from that time. The Danes, after making some\n            Difficulties, at last, agreed to pass the Elbe [\u2026]<sup id=\"xref2\"><a href=\"#fn2\">2<\/a><\/sup><\/p><\/div>\n    <p id=\"idm45643881891600\">Denmark, it should be noted, was a perennial enemy to Sweden, which \u2014 in turn, from the\n        days of the Thirty Years War \u2014 was one of France\u2019s closest and most subsidised allies, the Catholic-Lutheran\n        divide notwithstanding. Against this background, therefore, the purpose of Secretary of State John Carteret\u2019s\n        policy on succeeding Walpole was to raise the subsidy to the Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, to abandon the\n        neutrality of Hanover and to incorporate Hanoverian troops into the British military.<\/p>\n\n    <p id=\"idm45643879069856\">Newcastle accompanied George II and Carteret to Hanover in 1743. Back at home, the Duke of\n        Richmond was Newcastle\u2019s only trusted confidant at the royal court. There he played a crucial role in keeping\n        Newcastle informed both of the conduct of the war and of the political intrigues surrounding the appointment of\n        Henry Pelham-Holles to succeed Wilmington as First Lord of the Treasury.<\/p>\n\n    <p id=\"idm45643879054640\">On 30 November 1742, Newcastle wrote to Richmond of the results of his intelligence about\n        the shifting political constellations which extended as far as Moscow:<\/p>\n\n    <div class=\"blockquote\"><a id=\"idm45643879063632\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a>\n\n        <p class=\"first\" id=\"idm45643879087712\">Sweden in the height of their good humour with us, declaring the D. of\n            Holstein successor to their Crown, whilst Denmark lately sold to France, is arming against this French step\n            in Sweden, and the Czarina setting up another candidate to the Crown of Sweden, &amp; on that condition\n            offering us her friendship. This I conclude will be scarce understood by you, but I can\u2019t explain more by\n            letter, &amp; I beg you would not attempt to explain it to any Body else.<sup id=\"xref3\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn3\">3<\/a><\/sup><\/p><\/div>\n    <p id=\"idm45643879104432\">It should be remembered that King Augustus Frederick was the son of Christian August,\n        Prince of Holstein-Gottorp, as well as the father of King Gustaf III of Sweden, hostile to both Russia and\n        Denmark.<\/p>\n\n    <p id=\"idm45643879115536\">If that was the focus of intelligence on the macro level, on the micro level even the\n        appointment of a simple country parson could have perceived political implications relevant to intelligence. On\n        1 December 1742, Richmond wrote to Newcastle, re the disposal of two ecclesiastical livings:<\/p>\n\n    <div class=\"blockquote\"><a id=\"idm45643879119728\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a>\n\n        <p class=\"first\" id=\"idm45643879128864\">it is in a corner of the County where a clever Jacobite parson might do\n            us a great deal of mischief. The present incumbent (Robert Styles Launce), to give him his due is a\n            Jacobite, but he is so eternally drunke with rum brandy that he does us no harm.<sup id=\"xref4\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn4\">4<\/a><\/sup><\/p><\/div>\n    <p id=\"idm45643879137488\">Then on 6 December 1742, the issue of Jacobite propaganda was again brought into sharp\n        focus. Newcastle wrote to Richmond:<\/p>\n\n    <div class=\"blockquote\"><a id=\"idm45643879143456\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a>\n\n        <p class=\"first\" id=\"idm45643879146032\">there is a Book lately published, called \u201cThe Case of the Hanover\n            Troops,\u201d which endeavours to prove that from Queen Ann\u2019s Death to this day, the late King, &amp; the present\n            King have had no view in all their Measures, but to serve &amp; aggrandise the Electorate of Hanover, at the\n            expense of Great Britain, &amp; concludes, that the only Distinction is, Englishman, or Hanoverian or in\n            other words, King George or ye Pretender.<sup id=\"xref5\"><a href=\"#fn5\">5<\/a><\/sup><\/p><\/div>\n    <p id=\"idm45643879167904\">The background to this was that George II was said to be deeply preoccupied with the\n        defence of Hanover and was therefore keen to transfer his Hanoverian troops from Flanders to the Rhineland. At\n        the same time, though, bearing in mind the risks of a Jacobite uprising, aided by a French invasion, the risk to\n        Britain was increased. So, in 1741, when French military forces under Maillebois threatened Hanover, George II\n        felt obliged to sign a treaty of neutrality with France with respect to Hanover.<\/p>\n\n    <p id=\"idm45643879167104\">By now, it was clear that Hanoverian troops were, in any case, not popular in Britain. On\n        9 December 1743, Richmond wrote to Newcastle:<\/p>\n\n    <div class=\"blockquote\"><a id=\"idm45643879174976\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a>\n\n        <p class=\"first\" id=\"idm45643879179200\">I have said enough to you about the Hanoverians &amp; I am stronger than\n            ever in the same opinion. I think you would hardly carry it in the House of Commons (their employment, that\n            is), &amp; I am very sure our troops never will, nor never can serve with them, &amp; moreover, I myself am\n            convinced they are bad troops, so I hope in God you will not take me to be for them; if you do, you will lay\n            me under the greatest difficulty. [\u2026] I hope no time will be lost in applying for others, Prussians would be\n            the best of all, but Saxons are better than Hanoverians.<sup id=\"xref6\"><a href=\"#fn6\">6<\/a><\/sup><\/p><\/div>\n    <p id=\"idm45643879190336\">By 13 September 1744, matters in Europe had deteriorated and Newcastle wrote to\n        Richmond:<\/p>\n\n    <div class=\"blockquote\"><a id=\"idm45643879194768\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a>\n\n        <p class=\"first\" id=\"idm45643879197344\">The news from Holland rather worse, &amp; from other Parts not\n            better.[\u2026]The Elector of Hanover is specifically named, &amp; will be desired to join in the Treaty with the\n            Elector of Saxony, &amp; to furnish either Troops or Money. [\u2026] I wish I could send you any certain good\n            news from Moscovy.<sup id=\"xref7\"><a href=\"#fn7\">7<\/a><\/sup><\/p><\/div>\n    <p id=\"idm45643879211568\">The intelligence acquired, however, brought in some positive results: for one, the French\n        Marshall Belle-Isle had been captured in the Electorate in December 1744. Once removed to England, though, his\n        status became the subject of dispute as he had been seized in the midst of a diplomatic mission to Prussia.\n        Therefore, he was hardly a prisoner of war and, as a result, he was released by exchange in August 1745.<\/p>\n\n    <p id=\"idm45643879219728\">Intelligence from Scotland was also worrying. On 6 January 1745, Newcastle wrote to Lord\n        Chesterfield, Viceroy of Ireland and the author of the famous letters to his son:<\/p>\n\n    <div class=\"blockquote\"><a id=\"idm45643879107328\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a>\n\n        <p class=\"first\" id=\"idm45643879093296\">The landing of Lord John Drummond, the little assistance that has been\n            sent from Dunkirk to Scotland, the small number of Irish and French officers that have attended the\n            Pretender\u2019s son in Scotland and England, are appearances which I could easily account for without concluding\n            that France had seriously entered into the Pretender\u2019s cause. But all our advices (and <i>those which cannot\n                be intended to deceive us<\/i>) have for some time past represented the party to be taken in the\n            strongest manner, that the Court of Versailles <i>a besoin de bride plut\u00f4t que des \u00e9perons<\/i>, that at\n            present it was <i>cent contre cinquante<\/i> in favour of the house of Stuart; that the volunteers were\n            coming in every day at Paris for the <i>croisades<\/i>, that Mr d\u2019Argensen (Foreign Minister of France after\n            Carteret\u2019s fall in November 1744) in his discourses with the Pensionary\u2019s emissary declared that they did\n            not know who was King of England; that Prince Charles <i>avan\u00e7oit au tr\u00f4ne d\u2019Angleterre<\/i>; that they could\n            not treat with England; that it must be decided who was King. And all these menaces and gasconnades are\n            realised by the actual departure of the Pretender\u2019s second son (later Duke of York), the Duc de Richelieu,\n            the Prince de Turenne, the Duc de Monbason, General Buckley <i>en volontaire<\/i>, etc., for Dunkirk, numbers\n            of small vessels at different times assembled at Dunkirk, Calais and Boulogne, and particular days for their\n            departure named. And I think there can be no doubt but, if the rebels had continued in England advancing\n            towards London, and our army been at a distance from the capital, the Duke de Richelieu would have attempted\n            to make us a visit before now. And, though I rather think from the condition we are in to receive them and\n            from the number of ships we have at present at sea, and from the Pretender\u2019s flight, that their design may\n            be at present suspended, yet I am still of opinion that they keep it up and shall not be surprised if we\n            hear of them, and that soon, on some part of the coast tho\u2019 perhaps not so near London as was at first\n            apprehended.<sup id=\"xref8\"><a href=\"#fn8\">8<\/a><\/sup><\/p><\/div>\n    <p id=\"idm45643879177440\">On 8 June 1745, Stone was able to write to Richmond:<\/p>\n\n    <div class=\"blockquote\"><a id=\"idm45643879189536\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a>\n\n        <p class=\"first\" id=\"idm45643879217360\">A Messenger, last Night, from Hanover, and the Dutch Mail, which came in\n            about the same time, brought a Confirmation of the melancholy news received on Tuesday last, of the Victory\n            gain\u2019d by the King of Prussia over the combined Army in Silesia.<sup id=\"xref9\"><a href=\"#fn9\">9<\/a><\/sup>\n        <\/p><\/div>\n    <p id=\"idm45643879091760\">This was the Battle of Hohenfriedburg fought on 4 June 1745, which so glorified Frederick\n        the Great as a warrior-king.<\/p>\n\n    <p id=\"idm45643879092432\">Newcastle was able to intercept dispatches from Scheffer, Swedish envoy to France, sent to\n        the Danish minister, Count Bernstorff. Hardwicke wrote to Newcastle on 29 December 1745 that some of these\n        intercepted dispatches, in turn, had been intercepted by the French, through the seizure of a Dutch fishing boat\n        carrying them, because of which he felt that the original interceptions might have been based on falsified\n        information deliberately provided by the French. Be that as it may, it was clearly four years later that\n        Britain, with Hanover, had failed to keep France in check. Indeed, little had changed: on 7 September 1749,\n        Newcastle lamented to Richmond about<\/p>\n\n    <div class=\"blockquote\"><a id=\"idm45643879112144\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a>\n\n        <p class=\"first\" id=\"idm45643879114128\">France [\u2026] renewing their Subsidiary Treaties with Denmark, &amp;\n            Sweden.<sup id=\"xref10\"><a href=\"#fn10\">10<\/a><\/sup><\/p><\/div>\n    <p id=\"idm45643879119456\">It was left to Friedrich Carl Baron von Hardenberg, the Hanoverian Minister of State, to\n        cope with these affairs in 1750. As the latter half of the 18th century progressed though, the Jacobite threat\n        to the Hanoverian dynasty receded and ultimately ceased.<\/p>\n\n    <p id=\"idm45643879119168\">During the American Revolution, British and Hanoverian intelligence was focused on the\n        United States and, interestingly, Russia. In this context, it was bribes which played the major role,\n        endeavouring, in 1778 and 1779, in preventing Catherine the Great from declaring armed neutrality, which would\n        hinder the effectiveness of the British navy in searching ships aiding the rebellious colonies with war\n        material, as well as in penetrating the entourage of the American envoy to Paris, Benjamin Franklin. Then, in\n        1788, the Dutch were bribed with some \u00a3200,000, thereby successfully securing their support against the French\n        and obliging parliament to vote a supply of extra money for such future purposes. Both intelligence\n        interceptions and bribery were here to stay as means of achieving national security. That said, it was the\n        successful intelligence and counterintelligence initiatives of Pelham-Holles and his Hanoverian spies which\n        helped to ensure that the Jacobins were kept at bay and ultimately defeated. Therefore, when Prince Charles\n        Edward Stuart died, in the same year, the most serious threat to Hanoverian Britain was long dead and buried and\n        the latest French one was being contained.<\/p><\/div>\n<div id=\"article-back\" class=\"back\">\n    <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45643879124880\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a>\n\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Declaration of interest<\/h3>\n\n        <p id=\"idm45643879128272\">Professor Neil Kent is the Editor-in-Chief of the <i>Journal of Intelligence and\n            Terrorism Studies<\/i>.

Here we compare the audiograms of 26 wild beluga whales measured in their natural environment to a series of ecoacoustic measurements within a primary portion of their Bristol Bay summer habitat, the Nushagak Estuary in Bristol Bay, AK, USA. Environmental acoustic measurements were made during 2012 and 2016 using two different methods: a moored recorder and drifter buoys. Environmental noise curves varied substantially. Drifter recordings from the middle of Nushgak Estuary had the highest spectrum levels during ebb tides with acoustic energy from sediment transport extending well into higher frequencies (ca. 60\u2005kHz), likely due to rapidly moving tidal flow and shifting sediment in that location. Drifter recordings near the estuary mouth and shallow tidal flats were lower amplitude. Noise levels generally varied during drifts (in one case up to ca. 6\u2005dB) reflecting acoustic cues available to the local belugas. The moored recorder showed a substantially different spectral profile, especially at lower frequencies, perhaps due to its attachment to a pier piling and subsequent pier noise. Hearing sensitivity varied by individual and thresholds often fell above 1\/3 octave-band noise levels, but not overall noise spectral density. Audiograms of the most sensitive animals closely paralleled the lowest ambient noise power spectral density curves, suggesting that an animal\u2019s auditory dynamic range may extend to include its habitat\u2019s quietest conditions. These data suggest a cautious approach is necessary when estimating the sound-sensitivity of odontocetes found in quiet environments as they may have sensitive auditory abilities that allow for hearing within the lowest noise-level conditions. Further, lower level ambient noise conditions could provide a conservative estimate of the maximal sensitivity of some cetacean populations within specific environments.<\/p><\/div>\n",

Acoustics of the ocean in general has long been investigated but more recently soundscapes (encompassing all sounds within an area) of specific habitats or larger ecosystems have received greater emphasis (e.g., <a href=\"#B22\" id=\"xrefB22\">Haver et al., 2017<\/a>; <a href=\"#B32\" id=\"xrefB32\">Menze et al., 2017<\/a>; <a href=\"#B49\" id=\"xrefB49\">Reeves et al., 2017<\/a>; <a href=\"#B50\" id=\"xrefB50\">Stafford et al., 2018<\/a>). Thus in many areas, from coral reefs to the Arctic, we are still seeking to describe the variability in the acoustic environment found within a habitat.<\/p><p id=\"idm45142592692960\">Animals will use or be influenced by the soundscape they experience. Acoustic cues within an environment can provide vital information for detecting predators, localizing prey, navigating to safe habitat or shaping the communication among conspecifics. High levels of background noise, however, can limit the detection or recognition of important signals (<a href=\"#B4\" id=\"xrefB4\">Au, 1993<\/a>; <a href=\"#B14\" id=\"xrefB14\">Erbe and Farmer, 1998<\/a>; <a href=\"#B12\" id=\"xrefB12\">Clark et al., 2009<\/a>). Elevated environmental noise levels might be critical in cases where these cues or signals are of low amplitude. And indeed, we find many vital signals to be relatively quiet (<a href=\"#B56\" id=\"xrefB56\">Tyack and Clark, 2000<\/a>; <a href=\"#B29\" id=\"xrefB29\">Li et al., 2008<\/a>; <a href=\"#B24\" id=\"xrefB24\">Holt et al., 2009<\/a>); for them to be properly received and distinguished requires both sensitive hearing and relatively low background noise levels.<\/p><p id=\"idm45142592760400\">Among aquatic animals, odontocetes have relatively sensitive hearing (<a href=\"#B59\" id=\"xrefB59\">Webster et al., 1992<\/a>; <a href=\"#B39\" id=\"xrefB39\">Nachtigall et al., 2000<\/a>; <a href=\"#B37\" id=\"xrefB37\">Mooney et al., 2012<\/a>), however, as for many taxa, this sensitivity can vary within a species or population where some animals (often younger ones) have sensitive hearing and others have elevated, impaired thresholds (<a href=\"#B26\" id=\"xrefB26\">Houser and Finneran, 2006b<\/a>). Unfortunately, we do not have estimates for hearing variability in most cetacean populations, nor do we know their auditory thresholds relative to their natural acoustic habitat. Quantifying the audiograms of animals simultaneously with their acoustic habitat may provide insight into whether hearing is adapted to particular conditions of their environment, and how hearing is influenced by the natural variability in the ambient noise of that habitat.<\/p><p id=\"idm45142592862912\">Animal hearing and its relationship to the natural acoustic environment provides the context needed to understand the potential negative effects of anthropogenic noise on acoustic habitat. Human-produced noise has rapidly increased in the ocean in recent years (<a href=\"#B31\" id=\"xrefB31\">McDonald et al., 2006<\/a>; <a href=\"#B23\" id=\"xrefB23\">Hildebrand, 2009<\/a>; <a href=\"#B20\" id=\"xrefB20\">Gedamke, 2016<\/a>) from sources such as commercial shipping, underwater construction, resource extraction, scientific exploration, and military activities. This noise can have diverse and potentially serious effects on marine mammals (<a href=\"#B43\" id=\"xrefB43\">National Academy of Sciences, 2003<\/a>, <a href=\"#B44\" id=\"xrefB44\">2005<\/a>). Most of our understanding focuses on the impacts of intense sources and high received levels addressing affects such as avoidance responses and temporary hearing loss (<a href=\"#B36\" id=\"xrefB36\">Mooney et al., 2009<\/a>; <a href=\"#B54\" id=\"xrefB54\">Tougaard et al., 2009<\/a>; <a href=\"#B57\" id=\"xrefB57\">Tyack et al., 2011<\/a>). If hearing is sensitive, soundscapes are quiet, and vital cues are of low intensity, even small increases in background noise may have detrimental effects (e.g., not detecting or discriminating sounds). Given the pervasiveness of vessel traffic and many other human noise sources, measurements of \u201cquiet\u201d, natural habitats are becoming harder to record. Yet to adequately assess the influence of increasing noise it is critical that we compare hearing information to soundscape data, and ideally soundscape data without human-noise contributors.<\/p><p id=\"idm45142592685936\">In an effort to address habitat specific sound-sensitivity we need to acquire hearing and soundscape measurements in the same locations and general context. In this study, we measured the hearing of 26 wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas<\/i>) and the acoustic environment of a component of their spring-summer habitat in Bristol Bay, Alaska using two different passive acoustic methods. Belugas are highly dependent on hearing and underwater sound as their primary sensory modality for vital biological activities including foraging, communication with conspecifics and navigation (<a href=\"#B5\" id=\"xrefB5\">Au et al., 2000<\/a>; <a href=\"#B35\" id=\"xrefB35\">Mooney et al., 2008<\/a>; <a href=\"#B9\" id=\"xrefB9\">Castellote et al., 2014<\/a>). Beluga whales have been identified as Arctic ecosystem sentinels because they are broadly dispersed, high trophic-level feeders and are an important cultural and nutritional species for native Arctic peoples (<a href=\"#B38\" id=\"xrefB38\">Moore and Huntington, 2008<\/a>). Adjacent to the Togiak National Wildlife Refuge, Bristol Bay is a relatively well-protected habitat. The beluga population, estimated at 3,000 animals, is considered healthy (<a href=\"#B1\" id=\"xrefB1\">Allen and Angliss, 2014<\/a>). For several months in the summer, Bristol Bay is home to the largest sockeye salmon (<i>Onchorynchus nerka<\/i>) run and fishery in the world. Yet, most of the year, beluga habitat can be considered minimally disturbed and thus a representative soundscape of a natural estuary ecosystem. We compared our audiograms and background noise measurements to understand hearing sensitivity with respect to variability in a soundscape habitat.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"s2\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Methods<\/h3><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"s2A\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Study overview<\/h4><p id=\"idm45142592723616\">This study builds from a prior, initial hearing study of a wild population beluga whales. Following these methods (<a href=\"#B9\" id=\"xrefB9\">Castellote et al., 2014<\/a>; <a href=\"#B33\" id=\"xrefB33\">Mooney et al., 2016<\/a>) we increased the sample size of audiograms to 26 belugas (<a href=\"#B34\" id=\"xrefB34\">Mooney et al., 2018<\/a>). Hearing was measured in a capture-release setting in Bristol Bay, AK, USA. These data were collected during three ca. 14-day seasons in August-September 2012, September 2014, and May 2016. Ambient soundscape measurements were made during the 2012 and 2016 study periods. The hearing assessments were part of a beluga whale health assessment program coordinated by the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Alaska SeaLife Center following capture and holding procedures similar to those used in the 2000s (<a href=\"#B11\" id=\"xrefB11\">Citta et al., 2016<\/a>). Additional health and biological assessments were concurrently made on each individual animal during ca. 2\u2005h holding period (<a href=\"#B45\" id=\"xrefB45\">Norman et al., 2012<\/a>), after which the animals were released. The study was conducted under National Marine Fisheries Service marine mammal research permit #14245 and approved by WHOI and NOAA Fisheries, Alaska Fisheries Science Center\u2019s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Capture-and-release events occurred in the Nushagak Estuary (<a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1<\/a>), one of the two arms of the Bristol Bay Estuary Ecosystem used by Bristol Bay beluga whales.<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F1\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/688d2cc7-2b2b-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/ut_laboriosam_consequatur_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/688d2cc7-2b2b-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/ut_laboriosam_consequatur_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/688d2cc7-2b2b-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JEA-00021-2017-02.01.tif\" download=\"JEA-00021-2017-02.01.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure\u00a01. - Map of the Nushagak Estuary of Bristol Bay, Alaska, USA with the audiogram measurement sites (i.e., capture sites) indicated by the black dots and locations of ambient soundscape measurements indicated by the colored dots.<\/p><div class=\"fig-description\"><i>Audiograms and soundscape measurements were conducted in August-September 2012 and May 2016.<\/i><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"s2B\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Soundscape measurements<\/h4><p id=\"idm45142592758192\">Acoustic recordings were made using two methods. In 2012, a programmable DSG-Ocean acoustic data-logger (Loggerhead Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) was attached to a pile-pole at an unused cannery pier in Dillingham, AK, during low tide 1\u2005m from the seafloor and facing open-water. The DSG had a HTI-96-Min hydrophone (High Tech Inc. Gulfport, MS, USA) with -185.8\u2005dB re 1\u2005V\/\u00b5Pa receiving sensitivity, 20\u2005dB gain, and frequency response variability of \u00b11\u2005dB from 2\u2005Hz to 40\u2005kHz. The acoustic data-logger was set to record continuously at 80\u2005kHz sample rate and was deployed for 4 days while the beluga captures took place. This site was centrally located amongst the capture-release locations. Recordings for analysis were selected based on the sea state and the tide cycle. During the selection, recordings were manually scanned to check quality, confirm that the instrument was below the surface and check whether identifiable anthropogenic noise sources were absent. A total of 16\u2005min of recordings were selected across 8 and 9 September 2012, corresponding to periods of sea state 0\u20131 in flooding (ca. 5\u2005min), high\/slack (ca. 5\u2005min), and ebbing (ca. 5\u2005min) tidal cycles. The median spectral curve was calculated in 1\u2005s integration bins for every second of the selected recording periods across the full band of 2\u2005Hz\u201340\u2005kHz.<\/p><p id=\"idm45142592758992\">To gather more spatial coverage, in 2016, we used a custom drifter buoy instrumented with a DMON recorder (serial number 17a, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution) configured with a low-noise preamplifier (20\u2005dB gain), 13.2\u2005dB user programmable gain, a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter, and 32 GB of flash memory. The DMON was programmed to record from its mid-frequency hydrophone (Navy type II ceramics, with \u2212200\u2005dB re. 1\u2005V \u03bcPa receiving sensitivity), sampling at 120\u2005kHz with a 6-pole Sallen-Key antialiasing low-pass filter at 60\u2005kHz and high pass filter at 100\u2005Hz and a \u2212172\u2005dB sensitivity \u00b13\u2005dB within that 0.1\u201360\u2005kHz range.<\/p><p id=\"idm45142592760768\">The drifter buoy consisted of a spherical surface float with the DMON suspended 1.5\u2005m below the surface on a weighted line and deployed from a boat. After deployment, the boat moved \u223c1,000\u2005m away from the buoy, shut off its motor and drifted for 15\u201320\u2005min, and then the boat picked up the drifting buoy. Recordings were edited using Adobe Audition CS5.5 to remove the initial and final periods of the recording to exclude boat and motor noise, and recordings were inspected to remove any transient signal or self-noise prior to the analysis. Total duration of the edited recording files was standardized to 10\u2005min. Samples were collected at 5 locations across the region where belugas were captured during the health sampling within the Nushagak Estuary (<a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1<\/a>; <a href=\"#TB1\">Table 1<\/a>). For all samples, sea state was 0\u20131 with no precipitation and no other boats within visible (naked-eye) range.<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid table-container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-sm-8\"><div class=\"img-table-footer row\"><p class=\"fig-title\">Table 1. - Location and time of background noise recordings from the moored recorder and drifter buoy.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div class=\"col-sm-4\"><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-right\"><a href=\"#TB1\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span>Enlarge Table\n                        <\/a><br\/><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row inline-content\" id=\"article-table\"><div class=\"table-overflow\"><table class=\"table table-hover\" id=\"TB1\"><colgroup><col align=\"left\"\/><col align=\"left\"\/><col align=\"left\"\/><col align=\"left\"\/><col align=\"left\"\/><\/colgroup><thead><tr><th align=\"left\">Date<\/th><th align=\"left\">Lat<\/th><th align=\"left\">Lon<\/th><th align=\"left\">Time of rec start (local)<\/th><th align=\"left\">Tide status<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>9\/8\u20139\/2012<\/td><td>59 2.117N<\/td><td>158 28.383W<\/td><td>11:00<\/td><td>Ebbing, high, flooding<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6\/12\/2016<\/td><td>58 52.575N<\/td><td>158 34.175W<\/td><td>18:50<\/td><td>Flooding mid<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6\/13\/2016<\/td><td>58 46.235N<\/td><td>158 43.768W<\/td><td>20:12<\/td><td>Flooding mid<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6\/14\/2016<\/td><td>58 57.257N<\/td><td>158 31.061W<\/td><td>20:42<\/td><td>Flooding 1st 1\/2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6\/15\/2016<\/td><td>58 38.032N<\/td><td>158 46.137W<\/td><td>14:38<\/td><td>Ebbing mid<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>6\/17\/2016<\/td><td>59 2.434N<\/td><td>158 24.835W<\/td><td>16:04<\/td><td>Ebbing 1st 1\/2<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/div><\/div><\/div><p id=\"idm45142592772192\">All sound recordings from 2012 and 2016 were processed with custom written Matlab scripts, or in SpectraPRO 732 (Sound Technology Corporation) in the case of 2012 power spectral density (PSD) data, to calculate instantaneous pressure in \u03bcPa after accounting for the system gain and hydrophone receiving sensitivity. To address how sound levels varied between sites, we calculated PSD in dB re 1\u2005\u00b5Pa<sup>2<\/sup>\/Hz as well as 1\/3 octave band levels in root mean square sound pressure level (dB<sub>rms<\/sub> re 1\u2005\u00b5Pa). The PSD was calculated from 0.1 to 40\u2005kHz using the Fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm with a Hanning window equal to the recorder\u2019s sampling rate (80,000 point Hanning window for 2012 DSG data, 120,000-point window for 2016 DMON data), with 50% overlap, providing a frequency resolution of 1\u2005Hz. Sound pressure level (SPL) curves were calculated in 1\/3 and 1\/12 octave bands filtered using Butterworth filters with center frequencies from 0.25 to 32\u2005kHz and using the base 10 method. For comparison, SPL noise levels were also calculated in 1\/6 octave band filters (see Supplementary Figure). For each recording location, PSD and SPL were calculated over 1\u2005min integrations and the median value for each frequency bin was found. For 1\/3 octave band curves, the variance across these 1\u2005min time periods was described by the 25th and 75th percentiles.<\/p><p id=\"idm45142592776208\">To assess how sound levels changed over the 2016 sampling periods, root mean square sound pressure level was also calculated in 1 s integration bins for every second of the 10-min file across the full band of 100\u2005Hz\u201360\u2005kHz, using a 4th order Butterworth filter. With only five locations to compare we used the mean spectral curve to estimate the average sound pressure levels over time within all sites. This was done at each center frequency measurement and every 1\u2005s from all 10-min files. To visualize the site variability over time, frequency and sound level, 10-min spectrograms of the 5 locations were calculated in power spectral density in 1\u2005Hz bins using Welch\u2019s method with a 120,000-point Hanning window, a 1\u2005s integration time and 50% overlap.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"s2C\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">AEP hearing tests<\/h4><p id=\"idm45142592780384\">Methods are briefly summarized below; for greater details on the hearing test methods and population level hearing parameters see: (<a href=\"#B9\" id=\"xrefB9\">Castellote et al., 2014<\/a>; <a href=\"#B33\" id=\"xrefB33\">Mooney et al., 2016<\/a>, <a href=\"#B34\" id=\"xrefB34\">2018<\/a>). During the hearing tests the whales were positioned adjacent to a small inflatable boat. Hearing was tested using AEP methods similar to other AEP studies and identical to those described elsewhere (ibid). The AEP equipment was outfitted in a ruggedized case and the operator sat in the small inflatable boat beside the beluga.<\/p><p id=\"idm45142592828432\">Hearing was measured using sinusoidally amplitude modulated (SAM) tone-bursts (<a href=\"#B41\" id=\"xrefB41\">Nachtigall et al., 2007<\/a>), digitally synthesized with a customized LabVIEW (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) data acquisition (DAQ) program and a National Instruments PCMCIA-6062E DAQ card implemented in a semi-ruggedized Panasonic Toughbook laptop computer. Each SAM tone-burst was 20-ms long, created using a 512\u2005kHz sample rate and presented at a rate of 20\/s. The carrier frequencies were modulated at a rate of 1,000\u2005Hz, with a 100% modulation depth. The brief SAM tones create some minor sidebands (see Supplementary Material) but these were substantially lower than the center frequency, minimal at low amplitudes (near thresholds) and were not expected to impact hearing estimates (<a href=\"#B51\" id=\"xrefB51\">Supin and Popov, 2007<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm45142592833552\">The test tones were played to the beluga using a \u201cjawphone\u201d transducer located 4\u2005cm from the tip of the lower jaw on the animal\u2019s medial axis. The jawphone consisted of a Reson 4013 transducer (Slangerup, Denmark) implanted in a custom silicone suction-cup. The jawphone method was chosen because belugas freely moved their heads during the experiments; this would have provided varying sound received levels for a free-field transducer. By always placing the jawphone at one consistent location (i.e., the tip of the lower jaw), it was possible to easily provide comparable stimuli within a session and between animals despite movement of their heads. The specific location was used because it has been identified as a region of primary acoustic sensitivity for belugas (<a href=\"#B35\" id=\"xrefB35\">Mooney et al., 2008<\/a>) and it likely ensonified both ears equally. Prior studies have also shown comparable audiograms between jawphone and free-field measurements (<a href=\"#B17\" id=\"xrefB17\">Finneran and Houser, 2006<\/a>; <a href=\"#B25\" id=\"xrefB25\">Houser and Finneran, 2006a<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm45142592858944\">Hearing was tested at multiple frequencies (4\u2013180\u2005kHz) although not all frequencies were tested on all animals because of the time limitations associated with each capture situation. The stimuli were calibrated each year both prior to, and immediately after, the experiment. During calibration, the jawphone projector and Reson 4013 receiver were placed in salt water 50\u2005cm apart at 1\u2005m depth. Fifty cm is the approximate distance from jaw tip to auditory bulla in an adult beluga. The received signals were viewed on an oscilloscope and the peak-to-peak voltages (Vp-p) were measured. These values were then calculated into sound pressure levels (dBp-p re 1\u2005\u03bcPa) (<a href=\"#B4\" id=\"xrefB4\">Au, 1993<\/a>). This SPLp-p was converted to calculate peak equivalent RMS (peRMS) by subtracting 15\u2005dB, an estimate of RMS dB, which was then used to calculate the SPL (<a href=\"#B52\" id=\"xrefB52\">Supin et al., 2001<\/a>; <a href=\"#B40\" id=\"xrefB40\">Nachtigall et al., 2008<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm45142592868464\">Evoked potential recordings were made using gold EEG electrodes (Grass Technologies, Warwick, RI, USA) embedded in custom-built silicone suction cups. The active electrode was attached about 3\u20134\u2005cm behind the blowhole approximately over the brainstem. The reference (inverting) electrode was attached distal to the active electrode, on the animal\u2019s back typically near the anterior terminus of the dorsal ridge. A third suction-cup sensor was also placed dorsally, typically posterior to the dorsal ridge.<\/p><p id=\"idm45142592870160\">The electrodes were connected to a biological amplifier (CP511, Grass Technologies), which amplified all responses 10,000-fold and bandpass filtered (300\u20133,000\u2009Hz). The AEP data were finally imputed into the laptop and recorded using the same DAQ card and custom program. Responses were sampled at 16\u2009kHz and 30-ms sweeps beginning coincident with stimulus presentation. Stimuli were presented 500 times for each sound level and 500 corresponding AEP responses were averaged and stored for later data analyses. Sound levels were decreased in steps of 5\u201310\u2009dB until responses (evoked responses and FFT peaks) were no longer visually detectable for two to three trials. Decibel step size was based on the amplitude of the signal and the animal\u2019s neurological response.<\/p><p id=\"idm45142592870688\">Audiogram thresholds were calculated offline. Records were initially viewed in the time-domain. A 16-ms portion of this record, from 5 to 21\u2005ms, was then converted to the frequency domain by calculating a 256-point FFT. The FFT provided a peak at the 1,000\u2005Hz signal modulation rate. This peak value was used to estimate the magnitude of the response evoked. These values were then plotted as response intensity against SPL of the stimulus at a given frequency. A linear regression addressing the data points was then used to find the hypothetical point where there would be no response and thus the animal\u2019s threshold. Analyses were conducted using EXCEL, Matlab and MINITAB software.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"s3\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Results and discussion<\/h3><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"s3A\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Comparisons within the estuary<\/h4><p id=\"idm45142592883248\">Soundscape recordings and audiograms were made throughout Nushagak Estuary beluga habitat (<a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1<\/a>), and the acoustic environment in this area showed an important level of variability (<a href=\"#F2\">Figure 2<\/a>). The PSD curves for each of 2016s 5-days sampled with a drifter buoy showed background noise levels were quite variable when measured at different locations across the bay. Differences among locations were as large as 31.8\u2005dB at 17\u2005kHz (<a href=\"#F2\">Figure 2<\/a>). Three of the 5 measurement locations (12th, 14th and 17th May 2016) showed higher PSD values than the average (<a href=\"#F2\">Figure 2<\/a>). These locations were farther north into the Nushagak Estuary, where the river configuration is narrower and thus currents are stronger than in the lower end of the estuary, near the entrance to Bristol Bay. Also, these locations were further away from shore, closer to the main river channel where currents are also expected to be stronger. The elevated noise levels observed at these locations were likely due to sediment transport noise by current flow (<a href=\"#B53\" id=\"xrefB53\">Thorne, 1985<\/a>; <a href=\"#B6\" id=\"xrefB6\">Barton et al., 2010<\/a>; <a href=\"#B7\" id=\"xrefB7\">Bassett et al., 2013<\/a>). These authors show how the inter-particle collisions of bedload material (coarse sand and gravel) significantly increase noise levels often from 4 to 30\u2005kHz. But at times, this sediment noise can extend far into the ultrasonic, near 100\u2005kHz, depending on grain size and current speed (ibid). This elevated background noise is typical of other tidal estuaries (e.g., <a href=\"#B7\" id=\"xrefB7\">Bassett et al., 2013<\/a>; <a href=\"#B10\" id=\"xrefB10\">Castellote et al., 2016<\/a>).

There is also likely less sediment transport noise in these locations and the mudflats may have offered some shading from the noise of the central estuary areas. Unfortunately, while these point measurements offer some assessment of spatial differences it was difficult to assess the effects of tidal cycle on estuary noise levels. Yet currents and subsequent sediment transport noise undoubtedly will contribute to the habitat soundscape and this subject deserves further investigation. The spectrograms of each sampled location demonstrate the differences at the various sites. For example, a band of increased acoustic energy is clearly visible around 15\u201325\u2005kHz on 12 May (<a href=\"#F3\">Figure 3<\/a>) and is reflected in a peak on that date in the PSD (<a href=\"#F2\">Figure 2<\/a>).<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F3\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/688d2cc7-2b2b-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/tenetur_est_saepe_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/688d2cc7-2b2b-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/tenetur_est_saepe_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/688d2cc7-2b2b-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JEA-00021-2017-02.03.tif\" download=\"JEA-00021-2017-02.03.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure\u00a03. - Spectrograms of the 5 locations measured in 2016.<\/p><div class=\"fig-description\"><i>Ten-minute spectrograms (0.1\u201360\u2005kHz) of the 5 locations measured in 2016.

The 12 and 13 May recordings were essentially flat (with some small fluctuations). The 25\u201375% range of SPL curve for 13 May was small (so much that it is not very visible in <a href=\"#F2\">Figure 2<\/a>), and was essentially flat over time (<a href=\"#F4\">Figure 4<\/a>). The 12 May SPL fluctuated slightly just below 105\u2005dB (<a href=\"#F4\">Figure 4<\/a>). However 14 May showed a general increase in sound pressure from 115\u2005dB to just over 120\u2005dB over the 10-min recording period. The 15 and 17 May recordings also showed a slight increase (from 104 to 106\u2005dB). Thus there were clear temporal differences within some locations despite the short duration of our background noise samples. These changes were likely due to tidal stage and benthic substrate composition. The tide influences current speed and both influence noise related to sediment transport. In other words, the changes were most likely related to the changing position of the drifter buoy and its approach or movement away from areas of greater or lesser current-related noise conditions. A combination of longer duration stationary and drifting recordings would help explain some of these spatial and temporal differences. When results from the short-term drifter buoy are compared to the 4-day stationary recording results, it is evident that low frequency noise, up to \u223c5\u2005kHz, dominated the environment at the cannery location. Sound pressure levels for these frequencies were similar to the measurements obtained by the drifter buoy system (<a href=\"#F2\">Figure 2B<\/a>). While this may be a temporal difference (i.e., 2012 vs. 2016) of the Nushagak ecosystem there is little reason to believe such vast differences in the bay occurred during this time. We suggest the low frequency noise on the pile recording was likely an effect of wave action on the piles and shore, and increased flow noise by the platform structures at high current periods. Even though the cannery was no longer operative, the area was still exposed to diverse human activities from the nearby town. Thus, despite manual removal of transient signals, some low frequency anthropogenic noise could also be reflected in the PSD plot. The gradual almost linear decrease in noise levels from \u223c5\u2005kHz up to the highest frequencies sampled in 2012 suggests a lack of sediment transport noise by current flow, as opposed to the typical convex shape of the PSD plots obtained in all other study areas. The acoustic environment in this section of the Nushagak beluga habitat seems to be dominated by different natural and anthropogenic shore-related elements and highlights the diversity in soundscapes within the beluga habitat in this estuary.<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F4\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/688d2cc7-2b2b-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/tenetur_soluta_dolorem_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/688d2cc7-2b2b-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/tenetur_soluta_dolorem_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/688d2cc7-2b2b-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JEA-00021-2017-02.04.tif\" download=\"JEA-00021-2017-02.04.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure\u00a04. - Drifter-measured soundscape SPL of the 5 locations measured in 2016.<\/p><div class=\"fig-description\"><i>Ambient soundscapes of the 5 locations measured in 2016 over the 10\u2005min sampling periods, shown in broadband (0.1\u201360\u2005kHz) sound pressure levels.

There appears to be some tendency for belugas feeding in Nushagak Bay to occupy mud flats and river mouths (<a href=\"#B11\" id=\"xrefB11\">Citta et al., 2016<\/a>). Our results show these areas have quieter soundscapes. However, this beluga habitat preference is more likely a feeding strategy related to prey accessibility rather than a preference for lower-noise habitats.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"s3B\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Masking considerations<\/h4><p id=\"idm45142592694832\">A challenge when comparing soundscape data to hearing thresholds is how to present the environmental data. Environmental data (or the background noise of laboratory test environments) are often presented in PSD which is typically 1\u2005Hz resolution; yet mammalian auditory filter theory suggests hearing functions in wider frequency bands. Sound pressure levels are often integrated within frequency bands, however, with respect to hearing, the width of these bands is not precisely known (see below). Here we present environmental data in both PSD and SPL (in 1\/3 and 1\/12 octaves) for a broader comparison. The audiograms of the most sensitive belugas were similar to the mean and lower boundary of the 2016 ambient PSD levels, both in sound level (dB) and shape (<a href=\"#F5\">Figure 5A<\/a>). Further, PSD levels were lower than the median auditory thresholds \u00b125\/75% (<a href=\"#F5\">Figure 5B<\/a>). Such data might suggest that in many locations, or at certain tide periods, beluga hearing is shaped by the acoustic environment in a substantial portion of their functional hearing range (approximately 4\u201360\u2005kHz, <a href=\"#F2\">Figure 2A<\/a>). Sensitive hearing within a quiet soundscape could allow belugas to detect predators (i.e., killer whales), communicate with their young via low-amplitude signals, and use low-amplitude environmental cues to navigate within a complex river environment. How belugas use hearing to navigate in Bristol Bay has yet to be determined.<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F5\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/688d2cc7-2b2b-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/voluptatibus_iusto_vitae_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/688d2cc7-2b2b-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/voluptatibus_iusto_vitae_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/688d2cc7-2b2b-11e8-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JEA-00021-2017-02.05.tif\" download=\"JEA-00021-2017-02.05.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure\u00a05. - Hearing thresholds with respect to habitat noise measurements.<\/p><div class=\"fig-description\"><i>Hearing thresholds (audiograms, in greyscale) for (a) all 26 belugas measured, and (b) the median thresholds (black line) with 25\u201375% range (grey lines).

The 2012 and 2016 1\/3-octave band analyses (SPL) indicated that estimated auditory filter bandlevel noise was often higher than the hearing threshold of most belugas measured suggesting masking may often occur (<a href=\"#F5\">Figure 5C\u2013F<\/a>). To compensate for this there are mechanisms that appear to improve hearing abilities including signal detection and discrimination. For example, narrowing auditory filters improves frequency tuning and resolution (<a href=\"#B27\" id=\"xrefB27\">Klishin et al., 2000<\/a>; <a href=\"#B13\" id=\"xrefB13\">Erbe, 2008<\/a>). High temporal resolution, as in many birds, can aid in discriminating between calls of different species, different individuals, and between different segments of the same call (<a href=\"#B30\" id=\"xrefB30\">Lohr et al., 2006<\/a>). However, while these capabilities can enhance signal discrimination when sound levels are close to those of the background noise, it is not possible for animals to hear sound levels below the environmental noise. Thus, background noise remains a limiting structure in an animal\u2019s habitat.<\/p><p id=\"idm45142592773504\">Yet there are conditions in which signal detection improves despite the presence of some noise. When noise is temporally fluctuating or relatively broadband, such as in snapping shrimp pulses, co-modulated wideband noise and certain environmental noise (e.g., natural soundscapes), masking may be \u201creleased\u201d (<a href=\"#B8\" id=\"xrefB8\">Branstetter and Finneran, 2008<\/a>; <a href=\"#B55\" id=\"xrefB55\">Trickey et al., 2010<\/a>). Consequently, signal detection in the presence of this noise with \u201cgaps\u201d is improved compared to signal detection during Gaussian distributed, non-fluctuating wide-band noise (<a href=\"#B8\" id=\"xrefB8\">Branstetter and Finneran, 2008<\/a>; <a href=\"#B55\" id=\"xrefB55\">Trickey et al., 2010<\/a>). It is suspected that in temporally varying noise animals can hear during the low-noise gap (quiet) periods. They may also be able to compare temporal envelope information (essentially comparing the temporal sound patterns) across auditory filters to aid in signal detection (ibid). Both mechanisms are likely available to odontocetes. The noise noted here is both broadband and temporally fluctuating, thus belugas may be able to cope with some of the masking conditions.<\/p><p id=\"idm45142592905488\">One challenge to relating audiogram sensitivities to noise measurements is our limited understanding of the auditory filter bandwidths of belugas. Masking studies have been conducted with just a few animals, some with apparent hearing loss, and these studies have found some slightly differing results (e.g., constant vs. narrowing filter bandwidths, and some debate regarding the width of the auditory filters) (<a href=\"#B14\" id=\"xrefB14\">Erbe and Farmer, 1998<\/a>; <a href=\"#B27\" id=\"xrefB27\">Klishin et al., 2000<\/a>; <a href=\"#B18\" id=\"xrefB18\">Finneran et al., 2002<\/a>; <a href=\"#B13\" id=\"xrefB13\">Erbe, 2008<\/a>). While some prior results do suggest relatively narrow filter bands (1\/6, 1\/12, to 1\/16 of an octave) (<a href=\"#B27\" id=\"xrefB27\">Klishin et al., 2000<\/a>; <a href=\"#B13\" id=\"xrefB13\">Erbe, 2008<\/a>), we used both a 1\/3 estimate to enable a more consistent comparison with most auditory research available, and a narrower 1\/12 estimate for contrast (<a href=\"#F5\">Figure 5C<\/a>\u2013<a href=\"#F5\">F<\/a>). For comparative purposes, measurements using 1\/6 octave band levels of environmental noise are reported in the Supplementary Material.<\/p><p id=\"idm45142592866960\">A related metric known as the critical ratio (CR) is based on the idea that since only a small band of noise contributes to the masking of the signal, the auditory filter bandwidth can be estimated by measuring masked tonal thresholds in wideband noise. A common feature among terrestrial mammals is that CRs increase proportionally as a function of frequency due to increasing bandwidths of auditory filters (<a href=\"#B61\" id=\"xrefB61\">Zwicker and Terhardt, 1980<\/a>; <a href=\"#B28\" id=\"xrefB28\">Lemonds et al., 2012<\/a>), but this is not always the case for auditory specialists. The CRs of mustache bats and porpoises narrow at frequencies overlapping their narrowband echolocation signals suggesting adaptations for improved frequency-specific processing around these sounds (<a href=\"#B47\" id=\"xrefB47\">Pollak, 1992<\/a>; <a href=\"#B48\" id=\"xrefB48\">Popov et al., 2006<\/a>).<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"s3C\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Ecological perspectives and summary<\/h4><p id=\"idm45142592793776\">Perhaps it is not surprising that these belugas have sensitive hearing that approaches the lower levels of noise within their habitat. Research of other taxa has sought to put hearing in context with local soundscapes. An estimated two-thirds of freshwater fishes have hearing specializations. For example, common carp (<i>Cyprinus carpio<\/i>) are adapted to the lowest noise levels encountered in their freshwater habitats (<a href=\"#B2\" id=\"xrefB2\">Amoser and Ladich, 2005<\/a>). These low thresholds (and high sensitivity), however, can be masked in many parts of the carp range, where ambient noise levels are naturally higher. Some frogs\u2019 hearing, including the concave eared torrent frog (<i>Amolops tormotus<\/i>), is adapted to detect ultrasounds, because lower frequencies can be masked by low frequency noise from waterfalls within their natural habitat (<a href=\"#B16\" id=\"xrefB16\">Feng et al., 2006<\/a>). Yet, to date, there appears to be few studies which comparing hearing thresholds of wild animals to the noise levels from their particular habitat. Further studies are needed to address the soundscape variability of environments, with respect to inhabiting animals' hearing abilities.<\/p><p id=\"idm45142592690960\">There are many biological sounds which are low amplitude, approaching background noise levels suggesting animals do make use of faint sounds near the limit of detectability. This includes communication signals, sometimes between mothers and young porpoises (<a href=\"#B29\" id=\"xrefB29\">Li et al., 2008<\/a>) and humpback whales (<a href=\"#B58\" id=\"xrefB58\">Videsen et al., 2017<\/a>). The latter was suggested to be a mode of \u201cacoustic crypsis,\u201d making this acoustic communication an inconspicuous behavior in order to reduce the risk of attention by eavesdropping predators and male humpback whale escorts which might disrupt nursing and resting, and hence potentially compromise calf fitness. Further, there are multiple interspecific predator-prey interactions where the predator makes use of low amplitude cues generated by movement of the prey. This includes barn owls feeding on mice (<a href=\"#B46\" id=\"xrefB46\">Payne, 1971<\/a>), bats listening for fluttering moths or walking crickets (<a href=\"#B3\" id=\"xrefB3\">Anderson and Racey, 1993<\/a>; <a href=\"#B19\" id=\"xrefB19\">Fuzessery et al., 1993<\/a>) and lemurs listening for insects (<a href=\"#B21\" id=\"xrefB21\">Goerlitz and Siemers, 2007<\/a>). Conversely, the corresponding prey have often adapted to detect or respond to the often quiet approach of their predator (<a href=\"#B15\" id=\"xrefB15\">Faure et al., 1990<\/a>). Finally, the components (harmonics, reflections, amplitudes) of sounds, even lower amplitude sounds play a key role in distance estimation (<a href=\"#B42\" id=\"xrefB42\">Naguib and Wiley, 2001<\/a>). Thus detection of quiet sounds and hearing to the limit of the noise floor is often critical for successful behaviors and interactions. Varying natural environments will influence the success rates of these behaviors (<a href=\"#B60\" id=\"xrefB60\">Wiley, 2015<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm45142592737952\">This is a first step at placing cetacean hearing in the context of the soundscape in which they live. Such context is vital for taxa which are particularly adapted to aquatic hearing and show sensitive and broadband hearing abilities. Some of the belugas measured in this study show particularly sensitive hearing and it is possible that their environment enables such sensitivity. A large dynamic range of hearing encompassing high to low amplitudes works in quiet environments but is inherently limited in noisy environments. In other environments used by beluga whale populations (i.e., Cook Inlet, Alaska, USA; St. Lawrence River, Canada) noise levels may be substantially higher. It is not clear how this affects the hearing thresholds of these animals but masking would likely occur more often. Research investigating the impacts of noise on sound-sensitive cetaceans often focuses on response to high-amplitude sounds, however these results show that natural and human-induced low level noise could result in masking quiet but vital acoustic environmental cues for sensitive hearing in quiet soundscapes. Natural variability in the background noise could also dictate habitat use, such as where and when certain behaviors occur. For instance, calving areas may be quieter to facilitate mother-calf communication or predator detection. Also, masking can reduce the range of acoustic detection of prey and communication in cooperative feeding such that beluga feed more efficiently in quieter areas even when fish densities are much lower. Thus future work should clearly overlay soundscape measurements with movement patterns and assessments of habitat use.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"s4\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Symbols and abbreviations<\/h3><p id=\"idm45142592729504\">AEP \u2013 Auditory evoked potential<\/p><p id=\"idm45142592703760\">ASSR \u2013 Auditory steady state response<\/p><p id=\"idm45142592703312\">FFT \u2013 fast Fourier transform<\/p><p id=\"idm45142592702816\">EFR \u2013 envelope following response<\/p><p id=\"idm45142592744464\">PSD \u2013 power spectral density<\/p><p id=\"idm45142592743968\">SAM \u2013 sinusoidally amplitude modulated<\/p><\/div><\/div><div id=\"article-back\" class=\"back\"><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45142592697760\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Competing interests<\/h3><p id=\"idm45142592696768\">All authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"back-section\"><a id=\"idm45142592756128\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Acknowledgements<\/h3><p id=\"idm45142592862640\">We appreciate substantial assistance in data collection from Russ Andrews, George Biedenbach, Brett Long, Stephanie Norman, Mandy Keogh, Amanda Moors, Laura Thompson, Tim Binder, Lisa Naples, Leslie Cornick, Katie Royer, Dennis Christen, Natalie Rouse, Renae Sattler, Justin Richards, William Hurely III, and Kathy Burek-Huntington and of course local assistance from boat captains Richard Hiratsuka, Albie Roehl, Ben Tinker, William and Daniel Savo, and Danny Togiak and their respective first mates.

Technological advances now enable the collection of far more audio than can be listened to, necessitating the development of scalable approaches for distinguishing signal from noise. Computational methods, using automated species recognisers, have improved in accuracy but require considerable coding expertise. The content of environmental recordings is unconstrained, and the creation of labelled datasets required for machine learning purposes is a time-consuming, expensive enterprise. Here, we describe a visual approach to the analysis of environmental recordings using <i>long-duration false-colour<\/i> (LDFC) spectrograms, prepared from combinations of spectral indices. The technique was originally developed to visualize 24-hour \u201csoundscapes.\u201d A soundscape is an ecoacoustics concept that encompasses the totality of sound in an ecosystem. We describe three case studies to demonstrate how LDFC spectrograms can be used, not only to study soundscapes, but also to monitor individual species within them. In the first case, LDFC spectrograms help to solve a \u201cneedle in the haystack\u201d problem\u2014to locate vocalisations of the furtive Lewin\u2019s Rail (Tasmanian), <i>Lewinia pectoralis brachipus<\/i>. We extend the technique by using a machine learning method to scan multiple days of LDFC spectrograms. In the second case study, we demonstrate that frog choruses are easily identified in LDFC spectrograms because of their extended time-scale. Although calls of individual frogs are lost in the cacophony of sound, spectral indices can distinguish different chorus characteristics. Third, we demonstrate that the method can be extended to the detection of bat echolocation calls. By converting complex acoustic data into readily interpretable images, our practical approach bridges the gap between bioacoustics and ecoacoustics, encompassing temporal scales across three orders of magnitude. Using the one methodology, it is possible to monitor entire soundscapes <i>and<\/i> individual species within those soundscapes.<\/p><\/div>\n",

Acoustic recordings have several advantages. First, sensors can record continuously for weeks or months (depending on their power source) whereas an observer\u2019s ability to access and collect data in the field is limited. Second, multiple sensors can be distributed through a landscape to record simultaneously. Third, multiple people can listen to acoustic recordings multiple times, to facilitate interpretation. Fourth, recordings can be stored indefinitely until more powerful analytical techniques become available. Fifth, acoustic recorders create minimal disturbance and are unlikely to alter the vocalising behaviour of local animals.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129241249808\">The downside to easy acquisition of long-duration recordings is that most of it will not be listened to. Computational methods are required to reveal features of interest, usually by writing automated species recognisers. However, the content of environmental recordings is unconstrained, containing much that is not of interest and confounding to even well-written recognisers. Many papers and international competitions concerning computational bird call recognition depend on data sets that have been extensively curated and cleaned of unwanted sounds (<a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"xref18\">Priyadarshani et al., 2016<\/a>, <a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"xref17\">2018<\/a>) or only include calls recorded at close range. (Note however that the LifeCLEF bird identification challenge now includes several hours of soundscape recording [<a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"xref8\">Goeau et al., 2017<\/a>]). Consequently, writing recognizers is a time consuming and expensive enterprise. And recognizers reveal nothing about the content of a recording where the species of interest is absent.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129240961040\">An alternative approach is to treat long-duration recordings as soundscapes (<a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"xref16\">Pijanowski et al., 2011<\/a>). Here the focus is not on individual species, but rather on the broad categories of sound sources that contribute to the recording, typically biophony (sounds due to mammals, birds, frogs, insects, etc), geophony (sounds due to wind, rain, surf), and anthropophony (human-made sounds, whether speech, music or the multitude of machine sounds). To quantify this approach, acoustic indices, such the Acoustic Complexity Index (<a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"xref15\">Pieretti et al., 2010<\/a>) and the Acoustic Entropy Index (<a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"xref21\">Sueur et al., 2014<\/a>), are used to estimate the complexity of the biophony in a soundscape, which is, in turn, used as an indirect measure of species diversity and ecosystem health.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129240963008\">There is now a considerable literature on acoustic indices (<a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"xref5\">Gage and Farina, 2017<\/a>, Chapter 16; <a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"xref21\">Sueur et al., 2014<\/a>), but single indices do not readily reveal the detailed acoustic structure in long recordings. As an attempt to address this problem, <i>long-duration false-colour<\/i> (hereafter LDFC) spectrograms were developed. These are constructed by calculating three spectral indices at coarse resolution (typically 60 seconds per spectrum) and assigning the three indices to the red, green and blue channels of a coloured spectrogram image (<a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"xref27\">Towsey et al., 2014<\/a>). The spectral indices employed in this article to construct LDFC spectrograms are described in the next section.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129241979248\">A spectral acoustic index, as incorporated into a LDFC spectrogram, is better understood as a mathematical \u201cfilter\u201d\u2014it describes some feature of the distribution of acoustic energy in each of the frequency bins of a one-minute recording segment. The utility of the method depends upon combining three indices that behave as different \u201cfilters\u201d providing different \u201cviews\u201d into the soundscape (<a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"xref10\">Towsey et al., 2016<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm45129241980784\">Acoustic indices have previously been used to monitor soundscapes (<a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"xref5\">Gage et al., 2017<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"xref13\">Phillips et al., 2018b<\/a>) and, in addition, to filter long-duration recordings in the search for a single species. See for example, \n<a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"xref5\">Gage and Farina (2017)<\/a> who use spectral energy to determine the date of first appearance of the Spring Peeper frog (potentially useful in detecting long-term climate change). Here, we extend their application to incorporate multiple acoustic indices and LDFC spectrograms.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129241983744\">The purpose of LDFC spectrograms, when originally introduced, was to provide soundscape ecologists with a tool to navigate the content of very long recordings (<a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"xref24\">Towsey et al., 2015<\/a>). However, a surprising amount of detail can be obtained from false-colour spectrograms, even at a resolution of 60 seconds per spectrum, and it has subsequently become apparent that LDFC spectrograms can also assist ecologists in <i>bioacoustic<\/i> studies involving only one or a few species. The purpose of this article is to describe three case studies that highlight the utility of LDFC spectrograms in the study of individual species from three diverse vocal taxa: birds, frogs and bats.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45129240693040\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">General methods<\/h3><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45129241757200\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Recording acquisition<\/h4><p id=\"idm45129241755152\">All recordings described in this article were obtained with Song Meter SM2+, SM3, or SM4 recorders (<a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"xref28\">Wildlife Acoustics,  2017<\/a>). Each recorder was attached to a tree or metal stake at a height of \u22480.7\u20131.5\u00a0m. Recordings were saved in stereo, 16-bit WAVE format. Sampling rates differed for each study.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129240695232\">All recordings were mixed down to mono and split into one-minute, non-overlapping segments. Each one-minute audio segment was converted to an amplitude spectrogram using non-overlapping frames of 512 or 1,024 samples and a fast-Fourier transform (FFT) with Hamming window. Each spectrum was smoothed using a moving average filter (width = 3).<\/p><p id=\"idm45129240696128\">In this work, seven spectral indices were calculated for each one-minute segment. In our case, a spectral index is a 256 (or 512) element vector, each element of which summarizes some aspect of the distribution of acoustic energy in one frequency bin of the signal spectrogram. The dimension of the vector is half the FFT window size. With the computing resources available to us (a 16-core machine), we are able to process a 24-hour recording (sampled at 22,050 Hz) in 16 minutes. This includes calculation of indices and preparation of spectrogram images.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129240696256\">We present only an abbreviated account of the calculation of the seven indices used in this work. Further detail can be obtained in (<a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"xref23\">Towsey, 2017<\/a>). A three-letter code is used for ease of identifying each spectral index.

LDFC spectrograms are most informative where the three indices are not correlated.

Of the eight subspecies, two are of particular conservation concern. <i>L. p. clelandi<\/i> is known only from south Western Australia but was last seen in 1932 and is presumed extinct (<a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"xref7\">Garnett et al., 2011<\/a>). <i>L. p. brachipus<\/i> is restricted to Tasmania but has a patchy distribution which extends to several offshore islands. Fewer than 70 observations of this taxon have been made since 1995 (<a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"xref2\">Department of the Environment,  2015<\/a>) raising concerns that this ground-nesting species is disproportionately affected by invasive predators (<a href=\"#fn29\" id=\"xref29\">Woinarski et al., 2017<\/a>). Rails are detected primarily by their vocalizations, and most monitoring relies upon presence\/absence estimates using call playback and passive aural surveys (<a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"xref1\">Conway and Gibbs, 2005<\/a>). Repeated use of call playback (which simulates a territorial intrusion) may negatively affect resident pairs, resulting in territory abandonment or nest failure. Additionally, this methodology also requires a costly extended survey effort to enable high confidence levels inferring absence. Lewin\u2019s Rail vocalization repertoire changes temporally from an acoustically simple contact call to a complex call repertoire with harmonic elements that is thought to be associated with breeding. Vocalizations are also sporadic, and of either short or long duration. To establish their current distribution and evaluate their population status, a monitoring approach is needed that can reliably detect small numbers of individuals unobtrusively.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129241917552\">This case study investigates whether the application of LDFC spectrograms can detect Lewin\u2019s Rail at sites where its presence had previously only been confirmed by camera traps (<a href=\"#fn30\" id=\"xref30\">Znidersic, 2017<\/a>). Call detection was at first approached using an automated recognizer for the acoustically simple contact call. However, as the vocalization repertoire shifted to an acoustically more complex call, this recognizer proved ineffective. Here, we present the application of LDFC spectrograms as an alternative method for year-round detection.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45129241352304\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h5 class=\"section-title\">Method<\/h5><p id=\"idm45129241353040\">The study site was Tasman Island, Tasmania (43\u00b0 14\u2032 12.57\u2032\u2032 S, 148\u00b0 00\u2032 13.49\u2032\u2032 E).

The sensor was programmed for continuous recording at a sampling rate of 24\u00a0kHz, yielding 240\u00a0hours of audio. For calculation of spectrograms and indices, the recordings were down-sampled to 22,050\u00a0Hz. Spectrograms were prepared using a frame-width of 512. Spectrograms, so obtained, have 2,584 frames (frame duration = 23.2\u00a0ms) and 256 frequency bins (each with a bandwidth of \u224843\u00a0Hz).

Nevertheless, automated frog call recognition presents difficulties because frog chorusing behaviour involves multiple individuals of the same and different species calling simultaneously, thus obscuring the individual calls on which a recogniser is typically trained, comparable to the cocktail-party effect in speech recognition.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129241119104\">Frog choruses can be hours in duration and consequently soundscape analysis techniques become viable. Furthermore, three of the spectral indices that have proven to be useful for constructing LDFC spectrograms (ACI, ENT, and EVN) respond differentially to important distinguishing features of frog calls. ACI is sensitive to complexly structured calls having multiple levels of amplitude modulation. ENT responds to pulses or croaks having high amplitude, and EVN responds to high pulse rates.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129241119392\">This case study concerns frog communities on Groote Eylandt in the Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Australia. The island has so far remained free of the cane-toad <i>Rhinella marinus<\/i> invasion that is sweeping across northern Australia. The purpose of this study was to build a thorough understanding of frog communities on the island prior to a possible invasion. We originally approached this task by writing traditional call recognisers, but, despite some success (<i>e.g.<\/i>, <a href=\"#fn29\" id=\"xref29\">Xie et al., 2016<\/a>), this approach provides little insight into the north Australian soundscape and the place of frog chorusing within it.

Echolocating bats are typically surveyed by recording their echolocating pulses. Recordings are analysed using a variety of systems, the most common being manual analysis, where field recordings are visually compared to known reference calls and\/or published metrics (<a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"xref11\">Kunz and Parsons, 2009<\/a>). This type of analysis can reveal the species present, and an activity index. As with other acoustic analysis methods, manual analysis can be extremely time-consuming, limiting the ability to analyse long-duration acoustic recordings.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129241307312\">Given the high sampling rates required for bat recordings, it might be supposed that the LDFC spectrogram technique would be inappropriate for bat monitoring. Despite the increasing capability of recording technology, current storage limitations prevent recording for long duration at the high sampling rates required for ultrasonic vocalisations. However, in an acoustic study of Gympie National Park (<a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"xref13\">Phillips et al., 2017<\/a>), LDFC spectrograms detected calls of the White-striped free-tailed bat, <i>Austronomous australis<\/i>. This species is unusual because its calls are within human hearing range and just below the Nyquist frequency of that study (11,025\u00a0Hz). The White-striped free-tailed bat was detected in one month of spectrograms over 13\u00a0months of recording (<a href=\"#F3\">Figure 3<\/a>).

Typically, passes of moderate strength required at least 20 pulses to be observable; whilst strong passes were observed from as little as eight pulses. Whether a pass is identifiable to species in a LDFC spectrogram depends on the frequency of the echolocation, as there are certain frequencies where multiple species overlap. Even traditional manual analysis methods struggle to tease apart certain species from each other.<\/p><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45129240861872\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Discussion<\/h3><p id=\"idm45129240862768\">From an ecological monitoring perspective, LDFC spectrograms are a novel visualisation tool to assist detection of vocal species. With one set of \u201cgeneric\u201d acoustic features or indices, one can construct an LDFC soundscape spectrogram, with the additional possibility of detecting species of interest within that soundscape. Detection of an individual species (even at the coarse resolution of one spectral index per minute) is possible where its call has clearly defined acoustic properties. Importantly, these distinctive properties refer not just to a frequency band, but to a combination of features that yield an identifiable pattern of colour in a false-colour rendering.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129240863056\">Where the calling behaviour is extended through time, as in the case of frog chorusing, the resultant traces in an LDFC spectrogram are particularly easy to detect. However, it should be noted that there is no simple correlation between a species and the false-colour rendering of its vocalisations. Variations in the intensity and structure of a species\u2019 call\/chorus behaviour lead to variations in colour renderings. However, the extent of this variation can be learned with experience. The advantage of rendering three acoustic indices in colour, as opposed to a single index, such as amplitude in grey scale (<a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"xref5\">Gage and Farina, 2017<\/a>), is that three indices offers more possibilities to detect subtle changes in acoustic behaviour or to detect temporal and spectral overlap of different call types.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129240865120\">The LDFC technique is further enhanced by the ability to prepare spectrograms at different resolutions (<a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"xref24\">Towsey et al., 2015<\/a>) and by the possibility of constructing call recognisers with data sets derived from the same spectral indices used to construct the soundscape LDFC spectrograms. We believe this article to be the first published example using a (SVM) call recogniser to find bird calls within a LDFC spectrogram. The preparation of an automated recogniser is useful where an ecologist must scan many days of data (one LDFC spectrogram per 12\u201324 hours) to determine the presence\/absence of a species.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129240865904\">We have found that the seven spectral indices described in this study have broad applicability to many soundscape investigations, whether terrestrial, marine, or freshwater. The analysis of the recordings and the production of the false-colour spectrograms is entirely automated. We routinely produce two false-colour spectrograms, the first assigning ACI-ENT-EVN and the second assigning BGN-PMN-RHZ to the RGB channels respectively. After a short period of learning, one quickly recognises the sound-marks in a soundscape and whether calls of the species of interest can be recognised. Of course, further experimentation is required to prepare an automated recogniser. For detecting Lewin\u2019s Rail calls using an SVM, we found that a combination of five spectral indices gave the optimum result: ACI, ENT, EVN, PMN, and RHZ. The amount of time required to build this recogniser using generic acoustic indices (six hours to construct the data set, two hours to train and test an SVM recogniser) was small compared to the days of work required to code and incrementally improve the performance of a \u201ctraditional\u201d recogniser using features derived from standard spectrograms of the Lewin\u2019s Rail \u201ccontact\u201d call.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129241197984\">In addition, just to determine recall and precision rates for the \u201ccontact call\u201d recognizer required an additional 14 hours of manual work (unpublished data, Znidersic and Towsey). By comparison, using the LDFC images, near immediate visual detection and validation was achieved for the \u201cgood\u201d calls, without need for the SVM recogniser. Using the SVM recognizer accelerated visual detection of the difficult and very difficult calls.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129241104064\">Despite the above advantages, the LDFC spectrogram technique is ineffective where the species of interest only calls during the morning chorus or contemporaneously with many other species. In addition, in the case of bat calls, the method does not appear to detect very low amplitude calls compared to a well-developed custom recogniser and would therefore be inappropriate for determining presence\/absence of species of \u201cwhispering\u201d bats. However, the inability of the technique to detect Lewin\u2019s Rail and bat calls to the same level of accuracy as scanning standard grey-scale spectrograms with the human eye, deserves further comment.<\/p><p id=\"idm45129241339984\">Real world datasets derived from environmental recordings, present three difficulties, particularly when used for machine learning purposes. First, the number of negative instances greatly outnumbers the positives (1391:49 in case of the Lewin\u2019s Rail dataset). Second, in addition to geographic variation, the calls of most species vary within and between individuals. Third, poor quality calls will almost always outnumber good quality calls. This last difficulty, which has obvious consequences for training a recogniser, is a consequence of two physical laws: where a vocal species is approximately uniformly distributed through the landscape, 1. the number of vocal individuals at distance <i>r<\/i> from the microphone will increase in proportion to <i>r<\/i>, but 2. the amplitude of calls arriving at the microphone will decrease with <i>r<\/i><sup>2<\/sup>. These two factors conspire to ensure that a majority of positive instances in a truly representative data set will be of low quality. This is a common problem for real-world datasets, as opposed to curated datasets, because every call detected by the human ear is included (<a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"xref3\">Digby et al., 2013<\/a>). Both the Lewin\u2019s Rail and Gympie bat datasets contained a majority of poor quality calls, and standard recognisers or analysis techniques would also have difficulty with these.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45129241233248\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Conclusion<\/h3><p id=\"idm45129240921104\">The three case studies presented in this article describe the conversion of complex long-duration acoustic data into readily interpreted false-colour spectrogram images. Using the one methodology, it is possible to monitor entire soundscapes <i>and<\/i> some of the individual species that help create that soundscape. In addition, the ability to visualise sound scapes at multiple temporal scales is a distinct advantage and helps pose ecological questions that might not otherwise be obvious. An interesting feature of this approach is that it begins to bridge the gap between bioacoustics and ecoacoustics, two disciplines whose traditional temporal scales of interest have been separated by some three orders of magnitude.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div id=\"article-back\" class=\"back\"><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45129240809296\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Competing interests<\/h3><p id=\"idm45129246829984\">All authors, Michael Towsey, Elizabeth Znidersic, Julie Broken-Brow, Karlina Indraswari, David M.

One mechanism by which noise affects songbirds may be through acoustic obstruction to their systems of vocal communication. However, many species increase the amplitude or pitch of their vocalizations, which may partially mitigate the impact of high noise levels. When the amplitude of anthropogenic noise varies over time, such as near a moderate-use highway, short gaps between noise events may also provide an important opportunity for communication. But, whether songbirds adjust vocalization rates rapidly to avoid overlap with noise is unknown for most species. We used acoustic playback to expose songbirds to simulated road noise during the dawn chorus in otherwise quiet habitats. We measured vocalization rates under ambient conditions and during quiet gaps embedded within playback of road noise to assess whether a community of songbirds, and nineteen individual species, vocalize more regularly during noise gaps. There were no significant differences in community-wide acoustic output. Species-specific analysis revealed that only four species altered their vocal rates during quiet gaps in noise, but that the direction of the effect varied by species. Point count results revealed that birds generally remained on site for the duration of the experiment, suggesting that abandonment of noisy locations was unlikely to confound our results. In sum, increasing vocal output during short gaps in noise occurred in only a handful of species, perhaps contributing to the limited number of species that are found within noisy habitats.<\/p><\/div>\n",

According to <a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"xref25\">Mennitt et al. (2013)<\/a> the majority of the landmass in the United States is already impacted by anthropogenic noise. The spread of anthropogenic noise is not without consequences for wildlife; in some cases contributing to reduced abundance and diversity (<a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"xref24\">McClure et al., 2013<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"xref11\">Francis and Barber, 2013<\/a>), lower density (<a href=\"#fn02\" id=\"xref02\">Bayne et al., 2008<\/a>), reduced reproductive success (<a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"xref18\">Halfwerk et al., 2011<\/a>), and altered age distribution and mating systems (<a href=\"#fn32\" id=\"xref32\">Reijnen and Foppen, 1995<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn41\" id=\"xref41\">Swaddle and Page, 2007<\/a>). Songbirds are particularly vulnerable to noise, likely because they rely on acoustic forms of communication that are compromised by external noise (<a href=\"#fn39\" id=\"xref39\">Slabbekoorn and Ripmeester, 2008<\/a>). Yet, some birds possess traits that facilitate communication in noisy areas. Vocalizing at or shifting to higher pitches and amplitudes appears to reduce the impacts of lower-frequency anthropogenic noise on some species (<a href=\"#fn33\" id=\"xref33\">Rheindt, 2003<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn38\" id=\"xref38\">Slabbekoorn and Peet, 2003<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn05\" id=\"xref05\">Brumm, 2004<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"xref21\">Hu and Cardoso, 2009<\/a>). Pitch and amplitude changes may increase the likelihood that the signal is perceived by the intended receiver, however, both mechanisms may become less useful as noise levels increase (<a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"xref28\">Nemeth and Brumm, 2010<\/a>). Even at high amplitudes, noise production often varies temporally near most noise producing sources, such as roads (<a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"xref22\">Kerner and Rehborn, 1996<\/a>). Birds can potentially continue to communicate during low noise periods such as between car passes. As such, temporal adjustment may be a valuable and underexplored mechanism for communicating in noisy areas, but only if songbirds alter the timing of their vocalization rates accordingly.<\/p><p id=\"idm46057425210528\">Many species, including birds (<a href=\"#fn06\" id=\"xref06\">Brumm, 2006<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"xref10\">Fitzsimmons et al., 2008<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"xref20\">Hart et al., 2015<\/a>), frogs (<a href=\"#fn35\" id=\"xref35\">Schwartz and Bee, 2013<\/a>), insects (<a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"xref16\">Greenfield, 1994<\/a>), and mammals (<a href=\"#fn34\" id=\"xref34\">Schneider et al., 2008<\/a>), adjust the timing of their songs to avoid overlap with acoustic signals produced by conspecifics and heterospecifics. In many cases, aversion to overlap may be related to dominance hierarchies and behavioral state (<a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"xref27\">Naguib and Mennill, 2010<\/a>), but release from acoustic masking may also be important. Recent studies show that European robins (<i>Erithacus rubecula<\/i>), spotless starlings (<i>Sturnus unicolor<\/i>), and house sparrows (<i>Passer domesticus<\/i>) that inhabited noisy urban areas began vocalizing earlier in the day than their counterparts that inhabited quiet locations, potentially due to lower traffic intensities before dawn (<a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"xref14\">Fuller et al., 2007<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn01\" id=\"xref01\">Arroyo-Sollis et al., 2013<\/a>). Reed buntings (<i>Emberiza schoeniclus<\/i>) in roadside habitats exhibited higher singing rates on days when traffic levels were low (<a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"xref17\">Gross et al., 2010<\/a>). Conversely, <a href=\"#fn46\" id=\"xref46\">Yang and Slabbekoorn (2014)<\/a> found that Eurasian wrens (<i>Troglodytes troglodytes<\/i>) did not exhibit differential vocal rates between quiet and noisy locations, and did not alter singing rates during brief playbacks (20\u00a0s) of anthropogenic noise. Theoretically, concentrating vocal production during quieter periods embedded within high levels of anthropogenic noise could conserve energy and facilitate communication (<a href=\"#fn39\" id=\"xref39\">Slabbekoorn and Ripmeester, 2008<\/a>). But the extent to which songbirds employ this vocal pattern in response to noise is less known, especially over short time scales (<i>e.g.<\/i>, seconds or minutes).<\/p><p id=\"idm46057427369424\">We investigated whether 19 songbird species altered their vocalization patterns during quiet gaps embedded within short-term exposure to anthropogenic noise. Our exposure consisted of three consecutive mornings, designed to mimic the situation a bird may encounter at stopover habitats during migration, or on their breeding grounds as a result of temporary anthropogenic activities such as road and well maintenance or nearby logging activity. To avoid confounds associated with using roads and urban habitats, we played back simulated road noise in otherwise quiet habitats. We predicted that birds would increase vocalization rates during quiet gaps embedding within playback of anthropogenic noise because of the theoretical communication benefits.<\/p><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46057427371232\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Methods<\/h3><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46057427374784\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Site selection<\/h4><p id=\"idm46057427377520\">Research was conducted from 22 May 2013\u20134 July 2013, on the premises of the Pierce Cedar Creek Institute near Hastings, Michigan, USA (42.5358\u00b0N, 85.3014\u00b0W; <a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1<\/a>). The property was ideal for our experimental approach because low levels (&lt;40\u00a0dBA, re 20\u00a0\u03bcPa) of ambient noise allowed for a high degree of control over the noise present during each experiment. Twelve sites were utilized to compare vocal production under control conditions and under experimentally elevated noise conditions. Each site was located entirely within mesic hardwood forests dominated by a mature maple-beech canopy typical of the region.

Keys personal communication). Each site consisted of a circular 35\u00a0m radius recording area centered on a passive recording device (SM1: Wildlife Acoustics) attached to a small tree such that both microphones protruded beyond the tree trunk at 1.5\u00a0m above the ground. A portable sound production system (Pyramid PB444X 400W amplifier; digital timer, Diehl 884 series; 12V 10 AH lead-acid battery, and a Raspberry Pi computer) was also placed in the center of the sample area, and four playback speakers (25W, 0.4\u20136\u2009kHz frequency range; Pyle PHSP6K) were placed 1.5\u00a0m from the ground at 25\u00a0m from the center in each cardinal direction. Once a location was selected for inclusion in the study, two days of pre-experimental acoustic recordings were collected to establish baseline vocal rates.

Playback of road noise was introduced in experimental sites during this period. Playback consisted of a 90-minute presentation of pre-recorded road noise. The noise stimulus was a repeated 1\u00a0s segment of road noise cut from a high-quality recording collected previously near a high use highway with continuous traffic moving at approximately 65\u00a0mph. The 1\u00a0s stimulus was free from abnormal anthropic (<i>e.g.<\/i>, tractor-trailer or motorcycles) or biotic sounds (<i>e.g.<\/i>, birdsong). Playback amplitude was adjusted to ensure 65\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0dBA at the center of the site (1\u00a0min Leq; Casella 633 Sound level meter). To achieve this, the amplitude at each speaker was 90\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0dBA. Although playback speakers were directional, sound levels remained &gt;65 dBA for at least 10\u00a0m behind the speaker location. This extended noise exposure over the entire 35\u00a0m radius of the sampling area. Noise playback began 30\u00a0minutes prior to sunrise, and increased slowly in amplitude (linear ramp, Audacity 2.02) to reduce the likelihood that birds would avoid the area due to the novelty of the stimulus (<a href=\"#F2\">Figure 2<\/a>). Full noise levels were achieved by sunrise. Noise playback continued for one hour, but contained three one-minute and three five-minute quiet gaps. To avoid startling nearby songbirds, a five second ramp was applied to the offset and onset of all noise events.<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F2\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/69c92706-b977-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/perspiciatis_similique_quam_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/69c92706-b977-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/perspiciatis_similique_quam_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/69c92706-b977-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JEA-00004-2017-02_F0002.jpg\" download=\"JEA-00004-2017-02_F0002.jpg\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 2 - Noise playback and acoustic recording schedule in control and experimental sites.<\/p><div class=\"fig-description\"><i>Pre-playback treatments in all sites mirrored the control condition.

Ten minute point counts were conducted between cessation of noise playback and 1000\u00a0hours.

Our point count radius was larger than the recording area for two reasons. First, birds holding territories within our recording area are likely to move beyond this region regularly without abandoning the area. Second, human observers are not highly adept at placing birds accurately within a narrower radius (<a href=\"#fn37\" id=\"xref37\">Simons et al., 2007<\/a>).

Automated techniques included the bioacoustic index (min frequency = 2\u00a0kHz, max frequency = 10\u00a0kHz, fft = 512; <a href=\"#fn04\" id=\"xref04\">Boelman et al., 2007<\/a>) and the acoustic complexity index (ACI; cluster size = 1, max frequency = 10\u00a0kHz, fft = 512, units = seconds; <a href=\"#fn30\" id=\"xref30\">Pieretti et al., 2011<\/a>). The bioacoustic index is a measure of the area under the curve for all frequency bands that exceeds a set dB below the maximum (\u221235\u00a0dB in this case). This index was included as a measure of total vocal output. The ACI is a measure of variability in sound output over time and was included as an estimate of the chorus complexity since each additional species adds a uniquely varying sound signature. If noise playback increased vocal output as we hypothesized, we predicted that the bioacoustic index would be higher in gaps during noise playback. However, if only a subset of species dominated vocal production, we predicted that the ACI would decrease with noise playback. We calculated both indices for the first minute after noise offset in the one and five minute gaps during noise playback, and immediately following the completion of noise playback (<a href=\"#fn31\" id=\"xref31\">R Core Team, 2013<\/a>; package soundecology). The one-minute time period was selected because it encompassed the maximum duration that was available in all replicates. In addition, we manually counted all vocalizations from our 19 focal species in all one-minute noise gaps. Counts and indices were also assessed in gaps during the corresponding times in control and baseline recordings.<\/p><p id=\"idm46057427573440\">To increase the likelihood that we visually detected only vocalizations that were produced by individuals within our experimental plot, we played back pre-recorded yellow warbler (<i>Setophaga petechia<\/i>), wood thrush (<i>Hylocichla mustelina<\/i>), and red-eyed vireo (<i>Vireo olivaceus<\/i>) songs (common species at our sites) at the edge of our 35\u00a0m radius (80\u2009\u00b1\u20092\u00a0dBA at 1\u00a0m) during the setup of 8 sites. These songs were re-recorded with SM1 units at the center of each site. Recorded songs were viewed in Audacity 2.02 on a non-normalized fast Fourier transform spectrogram (fft). Spectral settings were adjusted such that re-recorded songs fell near the edge of visibility (Hanning, window size = 2,048, frequency range = 1\u201310\u00a0kHz, range = 75\u00a0dB, gain = 20). Thus, vocalizations produced beyond the range of our plots were generally not visible to the observer on spectral displays. These standardized settings were used for the duration of the experiment, and all visible vocalizations within one-minute windows were counted. Only songs were identified for 18 species. Kwirr calls were counted for the red-bellied woodpecker because this species does not produce song, but its call is associated with breeding activity (<a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"xref23\">Kilham, 1983<\/a>). Automated and manual analyses were restricted to replicates free from rain or wind (&lt;3 on the Beaufort scale).<\/p><p id=\"idm46057427581600\">Acoustic indices and vocalization rates were compared via general linear mixed models (glmer, package lme4). The global model for both indices included treatment (baseline\/control\/noise) and date (Julian). For manual counts, the global model also included species and gap order (1\u20133). Julian date and gap order were included to account for predictable seasonal and daily declines in vocalization rates. Site was included as a random factor in all models to account for the lack of independence between repeated samples at each site. Reduced models were compared to the global model to determine whether removing the treatment or species (where applicable) term significantly improved the model fit (compared via Analysis of variance). We also ran species-specific models which contained the same terms (except \u201cspecies\u201d) and significance tests as the community model. In models where the treatment term was retained, we ran pairwise comparisons (glht, package multcomp) to determine which treatments differed. The effect of noise on indices and vocalization rates was considered significant when the output during quiet gaps within noise playback differed significantly from both the baseline and control condition, and the direction (+ or \u2212) of the effect was the same in both cases. These qualifications provided a conservative test of noise-associated changes in vocalization rates because it required the presence of a robust and consistent pattern.<\/p><p id=\"idm46057427942048\">To determine whether birds remained onsite sites during experimentation we ran a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) test for differences in abundance between treatments, day (numbered 1\u20135; 1\u20132 = baseline, 3\u20135 = treatment), and the interaction between the two terms. Specific playback days were retained to examine whether abundance became increasingly disparate as noise playback continued. Each species (N = 19) was included as a dependent variable. Values of <i>p<\/i> &lt; 0.05 were considered to be significant for all tests.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46057427348832\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Results<\/h3><p id=\"idm46057427922816\">The best model retained the treatment term for the bioacoustic index (\u03c7<sup>2<\/sup><sub>2<\/sub> = 21.55, <i>p<\/i> = 0.039; details for all models can be found in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.veruscript.com\/a\/TLP16D\/S.1.html\" id=\"idm46057427940448\">Supplementary Material S.1<\/a>).

Because noise did not differ from both treatments, we did not consider the impact of noise playback on community vocalization rates to be significant.<\/p><p id=\"idm46057427382368\">The species term was retained in the community model indicating that not all species responded vocally in the same manner (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.veruscript.com\/a\/TLP16D\/S.1.html\" id=\"idm46057427381936\">S.1, Table 3<\/a>).

An additional eight species retained the treatment term, but did not exhibit a consistent, directional pattern of vocal increase or decrease under noise playback. Two species, the chipping sparrow (<i>Spizella passerine<\/i> \u03c7<sup>2<\/sup><sub>2<\/sub> = 39.29, <i>p<\/i> = &lt; 0.001, <a href=\"#F3\">Figure 3a<\/a>) and field sparrow (<i>Spizella pusilla<\/i> \u03c7<sup>2<\/sup><sub>2<\/sub> = 30.52, <i>p<\/i> = &lt; 0.001, <a href=\"#F3\">Figure 3b<\/a>), vocalized significantly less during gaps in noise playback than in baseline or control treatments (58.1% and 28.1% reduction from from the mean of both non-noise conditions, respectively).

Community-wide analysis provided no evidence for significantly altered rates of vocalization in gaps during noise playback. This non-significant pattern also held true for the majority of individual species, however, a few significant patterns emerged. Specifically, gray catbirds and song sparrows increased vocal production during noise embedded gaps, while field sparrows and chipping sparrows decreased vocal rates during the same period. Point count data suggests that the community composition was not altered during noise playback, making it unlikely that movement away from the noise source confounded our results. It is also noteworthy that results from the bioacoustic index, which did not decrease with noise playback, and ACI, which did decrease with noise playback, match our manual assessment of vocal output. The similarity in overall output is in keeping with the observation that two species increased vocal output, potentially replacing two other species that decreased output. But the reduce output of the latter two species would be expected to reduce chorus complexity.<\/p><p id=\"idm46057431475536\">A number of biological explanations could account for our generally non-significant results. First, it is conceivable that most songbirds are not capable or willing to make fine-scale temporal adjustments to noise. A physical constraint would be somewhat surprising given the number of species known to shift vocal timing in relation to other biotic sounds (<a href=\"#fn09\" id=\"xref09\">Egnor et al., 2007<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn07\" id=\"xref07\">Brumm and Zollinger, 2013<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"xref15\">Gil et al., 2015<\/a>). However our results are similar to those of <a href=\"#fn46\" id=\"xref46\">Yang and Slabbekoorn (2014)<\/a> who found that Eurasian wrens, a species known to temporally shift acoustic output to avoid conspecific vocal overlap, did not temporally shift song to avoid overlap with anthropogenic noise. Perhaps, the social constraints that regulate songbird communication (<i>e.g.<\/i>, <a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"xref19\">Hall et al., 2006<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn43\" id=\"xref43\">Vehrencamp et al., 2007<\/a>) prevent fine-scale temporal shifts in vocal production.<\/p><p id=\"idm46057427424784\">The lack of modification in temporal vocal patterns could be due to the recent evolutionary appearance of anthropogenic noise in the soundscape, resulting in an underdeveloped cue-response system (<a href=\"#fn36\" id=\"xref36\">Sih, 2013<\/a>). It is plausible that temporal shifting could become more common with increased noise exposure as a result of learning or selection for individuals that utilize noise gaps (<a href=\"#fn42\" id=\"xref42\">Swaddle et al., 2015<\/a>). It should also be noted that the current study was short-term, and took place within a community of songbirds that were na\u00efve to anthropogenic noise. If temporal shifting is a learned response, individuals that experience chronic noise interference may yet shift vocal production to utilize noise gaps. Novelty may also impact singing behavior. Specifically, birds may be less likely to vocalize due to a neophobic response to noise on the landscape. However, most species in the current study did not reduce vocal rates, suggesting that novelty effects were minimal. Longer-term studies are needed to assess these longer-term responses. Nonetheless, the lack of evidence for immediate behavioral plasticity in this trait differs from what has been found in other traits used to communicate in noise, such as frequency shifting (<i>e.g.<\/i>, <a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"xref17\">Gross et al., 2010<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm46057431479344\">Another possible explanation for the lack of temporal shifts is that noise tolerant species possess plasticity in other traits that allows them to sufficiently reduce overlap with anthropogenic noise. <a href=\"#fn08\" id=\"xref08\">Dowling et al. (2012)<\/a> simultaneously studied the effects of noise on four of the most abundant urban species utilized in our study (American robin, <i>Turdus migratorius<\/i>; Northern cardinal, <i>Cardinalis cardinalis<\/i>; song sparrow, and gray catbird). All species increased song frequency (pitch) as noise levels increased. Further, urban European robins (<a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"xref14\">Fuller et al., 2007<\/a>) and European blackbirds (<i>Turdus merula<\/i>, <a href=\"#fn29\" id=\"xref29\">Nordt and Klenke, 2013<\/a>) shift their dawn chorus to pre-dawn hours to avoid noise overlap. When studied in relation to urban lighting, the American robin also demonstrated the ability to shift towards pre-dawn song production (<a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"xref26\">Miller, 2006<\/a>). It is also possible that birds utilize microhabitats that are less impacted by noise, or move closer to conspecifics to facilitate communication. Perhaps these spectral, spatial and larger scale temporal shifts are sufficient for successful communication in species commonly found in noisy areas. Although testing these alternative mechanisms is beyond the scope of the current study, two of our species that altered temporal patterns also shift vocal frequencies in noise (<i>i.e.<\/i>, song sparrow and gray catbird). This anecdotal evidence suggests that frequency shifting may not preclude the use of other mechanisms for enhancing vocal communication in noise.<\/p><p id=\"idm46057427418736\">Four species diverged from the generally non-significant patterns. Song sparrows and gray catbirds vocalized more often during noise gaps, a behavioral shift that could facilitate communication within anthropogenic noise by utilizing limited acoustic space. The song sparrow and gray catbird are two of the more abundant species reported in developed counties within the study region (observed on 48.6% and 47.3% of ebird lists submitted May\u2013June in all years for Wayne, Kent, and Kalamazoo counties). Rapid temporal shifts in vocalization rates combined with frequency shifting (<a href=\"#fn45\" id=\"xref45\">Wood and Yezerinac, 2006<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn08\" id=\"xref08\">Dowling et al., 2012<\/a>) may underlie the urban success observed in these species. The field sparrow and chipping sparrow are less common in the region\u2019s developed counties (11.6% and 29.7% of lists respectively). Their reduced vocalization rate could be a direct response to anthropogenic noise or result of subordinate status when interacting with heterospecifics (<a href=\"#fn44\" id=\"xref44\">Walkinshaw, 1968<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"xref13\">Fretwell and Lucas, 1969<\/a>). For example, increased vocalization by song sparrows may have precluded the subordinate field sparrow from utilizing available acoustic space. This type of interaction has been noted previously in an assembly of anuran species (<a href=\"#fn40\" id=\"xref40\">Sun and Narins, 2005<\/a>). Under this scenario, anthropogenic noise may have a cascading effect on the songbird community (<i>e.g.<\/i>, <a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"xref12\">Francis et al., 2009<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm46057427359936\">In summary, temporal patterns of vocal output by a songbird community were generally unaffected by short-term noise playback, suggesting that rapid temporal shifting to maximize communication in noise is not a common avian response. Temporal shifting to avoid noise overlap may be limited by social constraints, and longer term noise exposure may facilitate learning or select for individuals that utilize noise gaps. However, immediate behavioral plasticity is uncommon. Only 4 of 19 species vocalized at different rates within gaps embedded in noise. Increased rates in song sparrows and gray catbirds may facilitate successful communication in noise-affected areas, and warrants further investigation. Conversely, decreased vocal rates in field and chipping sparrows demonstrates the potentially adverse impacts of anthropogenic noise on communication, either directly or through acoustic competition with heterospecifics for limited acoustic space. For most species, the inability to shift vocalizations into quiet gaps eliminates one mechanism for communicating under elevated anthropogenic noise. This may help to explain why a reduced number of species typically inhabit noisy areas.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div id=\"article-back\" class=\"back\"><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46057427949776\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Competing interests<\/h3><p id=\"idm46057427609424\">Darren S Proppe and Emily Finch declare that they have no conflict of interest.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"back-section\"><a id=\"idm46057427342448\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Acknowledgements<\/h3><p id=\"idm46057427951056\">Data collection was funded and facilitated by the Pierce Cedar Creek Institute in Hastings, Michigan.

This event gave Iran a new set of neighbours to the north, and this came at a time when Iran was undergoing changes in the direction of its foreign policy from radical idealistic goals, such as the export of the Islamic Revolution, to more pragmatic aims, including giving priority to its own national interests and pursuing good neighbourly relations. Since 1991, Iran has attempted to develop relations towards the Central Asian states, both bilaterally and through various regional fora. Iran\u2019s actions have been based, in part, on a greater commitment to regionalism that has been evident in Iranian foreign policy since the early 1990s. This has focused on cultivating economic, infrastructural and cultural links with the region, rather than any form of ideological crusade, and has helped reduce Iran\u2019s international isolation. Following a historical contextualisation and explanation of the place that the lands of Central Asia hold in the Iranian geopolitical imagination, the article explores the key concerns of Iran in the region. It will examine Iran\u2019s position on what it perceives as being the key issues shaping its Central Asian diplomacy, namely regional economic cooperation, pipeline politics, the status of the Caspian Sea, security cooperation and cultural diplomacy. This provides a revealing case study of how Iran perceives itself as a vital player in the region, seeking to emphasise the benefits of its geostrategic location, relative stability, and increasing international role following the nuclear deal.<\/p><\/div>\n",

This is borne of a deep historical connection, dating back not only to historical\n            control over the region through successive empires based in the lands of today\u2019s modern state of Iran, but\n            also the notion of Central Asia being the common home of the Aryan peoples from where the name \u201cIran\u201d is\n            said to have originated. This historical connection provided the basis for the renewed interest in the\n            region from Iran following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Iran has, for the past 25 years, sought to\n            build its relations with Central Asia and has often cited its historical connection as a basis for\n            developing relations. Perhaps, more pressing for the Islamic Republic, however, has been the desire to\n            capitalise on relationships that do not have the historical baggage that has traditionally hampered\n            relations with Western powers, namely the United States. In doing so, Iran has sought to demonstrate its\n            capability as a rational and reliable international partner for states in the region and, certainly, until\n            very recently, challenge US-led efforts at containing Iran\u2019s influence. To this end, Iran has historically\n            sought to promote a strongly regionalist agenda in Central Asia, which has met with limited success thus\n            far. If the Middle East is seen (by those in the Western media at least) as the place of Iranian\n            misadventure, then Central Asia is the place where the Islamic Republic shows its pragmatic streak.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm139739823402544\">Iran is a vital piece of the geostrategic puzzle that has long characterised outside\n            interests in the region. Iran sees huge opportunities in the region, not only in the oft-cited realm of\n            delivering Central Asia\u2019s natural resources to the world market, but also in developing closer ties based on\n            common cultural and security interests. Iran\u2019s desire for greater economic, security and cultural links with\n            the region has traditionally been stymied by two issues. First, the newly independent nature of these states\n            meant that they were loath to pool any of their new-found sovereignty into regional initiatives,\n            particularly those led by Iran. Second, Iran was hampered by the US-led containment strategy that sought to\n            keep its interests in check in its own neighbourhood and found an articulation in successive rounds of\n            punitive economic sanctions, some of the most damaging of which were linked to its disputed nuclear\n            programme. Now, following the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan Action (JCPOA), which saw\n            limits placed on Iran\u2019s nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief, Iran is in a position to make\n            some of its dreams vis-\u00e0-vis Central Asia finally come to fruition.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm139739823406768\">Following a contextual background, this paper will examine Iran\u2019s position on what it\n            perceives as being the key issues shaping its diplomacy in the region, namely regional economic cooperation,\n            regional pipeline politics, the legal status of the Caspian Sea, security cooperation and cultural\n            diplomacy. This provides a revealing case study of how Iran perceives itself as a vital player in the\n            region, seeking to emphasise the benefits of its geostrategic location, relative stability, and increasing\n            international role following the nuclear deal.<\/p><\/div>\n    <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139739823414544\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a>\n\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Iran\u2013Central Asia relations in context<\/h3>\n\n        <p id=\"idm139739823423904\">An unusual confluence of key events helped form the basis for the development of\n            Iranian\u2013Central Asian relations. The end of the Iran\u2013Iraq war, the death of Khomeini and the coming to power\n            of Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani in a more powerful presidency were all of major importance in the rise of a\n            more pragmatic foreign policy for the Islamic Republic. This change saw the placing of pragmatic aims, and\n            Iran\u2019s own national interests, over idealistic themes, such as the export of the Islamic Revolution. The\n            implosion of the Soviet Union in 1991 came as a shock to the ruling elites of Central Asia and also opened\n            up new opportunities for an Iranian leadership that was eager to demonstrate its credentials as a reliable\n            partner for the newly independent states. The Rafsanjani presidency saw a greater commitment to regionalism\n            on Iran\u2019s part, reflecting post\u2013Cold War global trends, and Iran sought to build links with Central Asia\n            through an expanded Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO). Until very recently, Iran\u2019s emphasis on\n            building these relationships had two important dimensions: one of these was the opportunity to lessen its\n            international isolation and build relations with its new neighbours as a means of reducing the burdens of\n            the American containment policy; the other was maintaining good relations with a key arms supplier, Russia,\n            and not pursuing policies in Central Asia that would antagonise her. These remain key considerations in the\n            post-sanctions landscape, and if the sanctions relief does go as hoped, bearing in mind that it has hit some\n            hurdles in implementation,<sup id=\"xref1\"><a href=\"#fn1\">1<\/a><\/sup> then it will become a significant area\n            of increased cooperation in a range of fields.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm139739823438912\">The 1990s and early 2000s also saw Iranian foreign policy studies reflecting the new\n            realities of Iran\u2019s international situation following the break-up of the Soviet Union.<sup id=\"xref2\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn2\">2<\/a><\/sup> This was evidenced within Iran, with the Foreign Ministry establishing the\n            Center for the Study of Central Asia and the Caucasus in 1992 and its publication of the English-language\n            <i>Amu Darya<\/i> and Persian-language \u201c<i>Motale\u02bbat-e asia-ye markazi va qafqaz<\/i>\u201d (<i>Central Asia and\n                the Caucasus Review<\/i>) journals.<sup id=\"xref3\"><a href=\"#fn3\">3<\/a><\/sup> Subsequently, Iran\u2019s\n            relations with the newly independent states of Central Asia and the Caucasus, and its attempts to\n            \u201creconnect\u201d with a region that is key to its own history, became an important area of analysis as the works\n            by Ehteshami, Herzig and others ably demonstrate.<sup id=\"xref4\"><a href=\"#fn4\">4<\/a><\/sup> While the\n            emphases of such works vary, from focusing on security, to economic links and broader regional initiatives,\n            the common feature that they all share is an emphasis on Central Asia providing significant opportunities\n            for Iran, whether real or as yet unrealised. A further common and recurring theme is that Iranian attempts\n            at expanding influence in the region have always been stymied by the United States and successive sanctions\n            regimes led by that country. Arguably, this is now changing, so that ideas and initiatives that previously\n            appeared moribund now have greater potential.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm139739823359744\">The works emanating from Iran, in particular, have a distinctly regionalist tenor,\n            emphasising Iran\u2019s geopolitical position vis-\u00e0-vis Central Asia,<sup id=\"xref5\"><a href=\"#fn5\">5<\/a><\/sup>\n            its position on wider relations with other powers such as Russia and the United States<sup id=\"xref6\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn6\">6<\/a><\/sup> and the potential of regional initiatives such as the ECO, which Iran was\n            particularly keen to utilise as a vehicle for its interests in Central Asia.<sup id=\"xref7\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn7\">7<\/a><\/sup> As noted, Iran has a long historical connection with the region, having at\n            various junctures in its history exercised nominal control over large parts of the Caucasus and Central Asia\n            up until Tsarist Russia\u2019s expansion there. This is something that is reflected in Iranian writing on the\n            region, with an emphasis on their geographical and, in some cases, cultural proximity.<sup id=\"xref8\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn8\">8<\/a><\/sup> While there is no space to discuss this long history here, it is the\n            cultural and, in some cases, linguistic commonalities that are a common feature of Iranian narratives on\n            building relations with the region. This cultural and linguistic commonality is used as a kind of vector to\n            develop relations and then build on this through investment, something that is particularly evident when\n            looking at Iran\u2019s relations with fellow Persian-speaking nations of Tajikistan and Afghanistan.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm139739823451824\">The emphasis on geopolitical and in a sense \u201cgeo-cultural\u201d approaches regarding\n            Central Asia from within Iranian academic and policy-making circles is certainly understandable when\n            contextualising its approach there. Geopolitics, after all, provides something of a neutral, objective and\n            ideologically free tool for use by foreign policy experts,<sup id=\"xref9\"><a href=\"#fn9\">9<\/a><\/sup> which\n            helps explain why it is useful for Iranian foreign policy in the region to be framed in this manner, resting\n            as it does on pragmatic rather than idealistic aims. The notion of Iran acting as a bridge or gateway to\n            Central Asia is also key in Iranian geopolitical thinking. However, despite the advantages of geographic\n            and, in some cases, cultural proximity, Iran has yet to fully emerge as a regional power in Eurasia in the\n            same way as it has done in the Middle East.<sup id=\"xref10\"><a href=\"#fn10\">10<\/a><\/sup> In the\n            post-sanctions landscape in which the international community is tentatively entering, Iran\u2019s long-held\n            assertion of its geographical position finally has the potential to become a reality. Some have argued that\n            Iran will pursue foreign policy \u201caggressively\u201d in region on account of their alleged actions in Middle East,<sup\n                    id=\"xref11\"><a href=\"#fn11\">11<\/a><\/sup> but such scepticism is misplaced and ignores that pragmatic\n            bent of Iranian foreign policy towards the region over the last 25 years. Now, it is in a position to reap\n            the benefits of its gradual re-integration into the global economy in the post-JCPOA landscape. Such\n            reintegration is not without problems, however. An issue of concern to many in the Islamic Republic seeking\n            to promote greater foreign direct investment in Iran and also by Iran elsewhere is the continued perception\n            of United States\u2019 punitive measures on banks doing business with Iran. Once the threat is lifted, then the\n            potential for further integration into the global economy will make Iran a more attractive partner for\n            Central Asian states. Iran\u2019s potential for greater engagement with the region has also been partially\n            assisted by the drawing down of the US presence there. Although the Taliban remain a security risk for the\n            wider region, the scaling back of the US presence in Afghanistan, and with it the military logistical\n            support used in Central Asia by the United States, suits Iran\u2019s aims in the region well. Iran is also moving\n            closer in terms of its military alliance with Russia. When coupled with an increasingly assertive Russian\n            policy towards states in its so-called \u2018near abroad\u2019, this means that Iran, as ever, remains mindful of\n            Russia\u2019s position in Central Asia. Furthermore, the re-emergence of the Silk Road as a viable trading route,\n            led by a key Iranian ally in China, will be aided by Iran\u2019s gradual reintegration into the global economy\n            following the nuclear deal. This is a key feature of the Iranian strategic thinking, with Central Asia, and\n            Iran\u2019s position vis-\u00e0-vis these states forming a key part of its wider geopolitical imagination.<\/p><\/div>\n    <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139739823367072\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a>\n\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Iran\u2019s interests in Central Asia<\/h3>\n\n        <p id=\"idm139739823388768\">Iran has multiple interests in Central Asia that shape its foreign policy towards the\n            region, from economic integration to cooperation in fields as diverse as security and culture. The bulk of\n            this article is, therefore, dedicated to outlining the key issues that Iran sees as important in the region,\n            starting with its attempts at promoting increased further economic integration.<\/p>\n\n        <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139739823393136\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Regional\n            economic integration<\/h4>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139739823393648\">Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Iran placed great emphasis on\n                developing greater economic cooperation between Iran and Central Asia within the framework of an\n                expanded ECO, and also in bilateral agreements with Central Asian states. Moves towards greater regional\n                cooperation, and indeed regionalism, first began to assume prominence in Iranian foreign policy in the\n                1990s during the Rafsanjani presidency.<sup id=\"xref12\"><a href=\"#fn12\">12<\/a><\/sup> Iran saw the\n                development of relations and regional cooperation with Central Asia as a means of reducing its\n                international isolation in the face of continued American hostility. This also has important corollaries\n                for Iran\u2019s domestic economic needs, with punitive economic sanctions stymieing development. The newly\n                independent states offered potential new trade partners and gave Iran greater possibilities for\n                engagement with developments in the resource sector. The Islamic Republic\u2019s leaders also saw greater\n                cooperation as being vital for regional stability and security. A key point that often arises when\n                discussing Iran\u2019s relations with Central Asia is its geostrategic location, and Iran\u2019s leaders are keen\n                to take advantage of this perceived advantage. As such, Iran is often described as forming a \u201cbridge\u201d or\n                \u201cgateway\u201d for the landlocked Central Asian States to the World Ocean. This is of particular use to\n                resource-rich states, such as Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, as Iran provides the shortest routes for\n                their hydrocarbons to reach the world market. However, the use of Iran as a transit country for such\n                resources and pipelines has been hampered by continued American involvement in the Caspian region.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139739823401008\">A major legacy of Soviet rule in Central Asia was that all of its industrial,\n                transport and communication infrastructures were orientated towards Russia and were servicing the Soviet\n                Union. The lack of transport and communication links to the south has historically been one of the main\n                impediments to further economic cooperation and integration with Iran. One of the key developments in\n                improving this situation was the completion of the Tejen (Turkmenistan) to Mashhad (Iran) rail link in\n                1996. This linked Central Asia to the Iranian rail network and gave Central Asia access to the Persian\n                Gulf. It was also of major significance to Iran in gaining further access to Central Asia. The\n                development of the rail link also showed evidence of the cultivation of good relations between Iran and\n                Turkmenistan during the 1990s and into the new millennium.<sup id=\"xref13\"><a href=\"#fn13\">13<\/a><\/sup>\n                In keeping with the more optimistic atmosphere surrounding ties with the Islamic Republic, 2016 saw the\n                reviving of a transport scheme that had previously lain dormant for 5 years, which envisages an extended\n                north\u2013south transport corridor linking Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran and Oman.<sup\n                        id=\"xref14\"><a href=\"#fn14\">14<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139739823411696\">Although this article focuses primarily on the relations between Iran and the\n                states of Central Asia, it is also important to note the role of China briefly. China is one of Iran\u2019s\n                largest trading partners and provided it with vital economic links during successive sanctions regimes\n                against the Islamic Republic.<sup id=\"xref15\"><a href=\"#fn15\">15<\/a><\/sup> China sees the value of Iran\n                as a key node in its One Belt, One Road initiative, which seeks to develop a modern incarnation of the\n                Silk Road. China also has experience of investing in Iran, particularly in transport infrastructure<sup\n                        id=\"xref16\"><a href=\"#fn16\">16<\/a><\/sup> and hydrocarbon development projects, although it\n                should be noted that the latter has been with mixed success prior to the recent lifting of\n                sanctions.<sup id=\"xref17\"><a href=\"#fn17\">17<\/a><\/sup> China\u2019s development of its new Silk Road project\n                is important not only for Iran but also for the Central Asian states, as it provides additional impetus\n                for these countries to diversify their trade and export routes. Iran is not only a useful conduit for\n                them alone, but also for part of a wider Chinese strategy that incorporates Iran and Central Asia.\n                Therefore, it is potentially a win\u2013win scenario for all involved in terms of transit fees and further\n                diversification of export routes and partners. Naturally, the sanctions regime ending also has a\n                positive impact in freeing up the Iranian trade route without incurring the risk of punitive US economic\n                sanctions.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139739823423472\">However, there is the possibility that further reintegration of Iran into the\n                world economy may have the opposite effect on Iran\u2013China relations. Although China has been the largest\n                market for Iranian exports, and second largest importer into Iran,<sup id=\"xref18\"><a\n                        href=\"#fn18\">18<\/a><\/sup> the Islamic Republic has moved towards courting major European\n                companies and governments for investment since the JCPOA. This turn towards Europe is indicative of a\n                broadening of options for Iran, insofar as it no longer has to be as reliant on trade with China.\n                Naturally, Iran would benefit from diversification of trade opportunities, and the view from Tehran is\n                that this can complement its existing relations with China by way of acting as a hub on the key overland\n                route to Europe.<sup id=\"xref19\"><a href=\"#fn19\">19<\/a><\/sup> To this end, the large-scale Chinese\n                presence on the Central Asian energy markets is more of an opportunity for Iran than a source of\n                competition for Chinese largesse. Furthermore, Iran is using the post-JCPOA landscape to ink significant\n                deals with India in the field of transport and energy cooperation.<sup id=\"xref20\"><a\n                        href=\"#fn20\">20<\/a><\/sup> Hence, Iran can make use of its long-held desire to act as a conduit\n                for Central Asian (and indeed its own) resources to the world market. There is also the possibility that\n                the Iranian route will introduce new competition with other Chinese-led initiatives, such as the\n                China\u2013Pakistan Economic Corridor route, though it has been argued that these are more complimentary in\n                terms of forming a wider network linked to the One Belt, One Road initiative.<sup id=\"xref21\"><a\n                        href=\"#fn21\">21<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139739823445680\">Ultimately, pragmatism persists in Iran\u2019s Central Asian and China policies. One\n                can see that Iran has sought to act in its own national interest, placing economic objectives at the\n                forefront of its foreign policy in the region. As Lotfian has noted \u201cIranians are not enthusiastic about\n                risking national interests for the sake of ethnic [or] ideologically based struggles in Central\n                Asia.\u201d<sup id=\"xref22\"><a href=\"#fn22\">22<\/a><\/sup> This is also true for its relations with China,\n                whereby Iran has been historically quiet on the way Beijing has been dealing with its Muslim Uighur\n                population. This is no surprise when one considers similarly muted positions on Kashmir, Chechnya and\n                Iran\u2019s close relations with Armenia vis-\u00e0-vis Shia Azerbaijan. Also, the fact that the Central Asian\n                states continue to seek ways of demonstrating their independence is to Iran\u2019s advantage, as it can offer\n                itself as a gateway to international markets, provide expertise in certain areas, such as the\n                hydrocarbons industry, and also offer investment in industrial and infrastructural projects. Naturally,\n                there are other implications that come with greater Iranian engagement in Central Asia, security being\n                one such area that will be discussed later on.<\/p><\/div>\n        <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139739823452288\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">\n            Institutionalising regional economic links through the ECO<\/h4>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139739823454048\">In terms of its potential and scale, the ECO remains a significant regional\n                grouping, with a combined population of almost 370 million people,<sup id=\"xref23\"><a\n                        href=\"#fn23\">23<\/a><\/sup> and although it has yet to fulfil much of its intent, it can still be\n                seen as a useful regional forum, the one which Iran has historically used to further its relations with\n                the Central Asian republics. The ECO member states signed the Quetta Plan of Action in 1993, which\n                envisages the development of an intraregional transportation and communications infrastructure. The ECO\n                has placed a high priority on this sector as a means of facilitating intra-regional trade, encouraging\n                the export of goods to international markets and linking landlocked states to international ports.<sup\n                        id=\"xref24\"><a href=\"#fn24\">24<\/a><\/sup> An ECO airline and shipping company has also been\n                established. Iran has been keen on highlighting the significance of its geographical location as the\n                following statement by the then Iranian foreign minister Kamal Kharrazi to the ECO Council of Ministers\n                in Dushanbe, 2001, demonstrates: \u201cWe shall pay special attention to the field of transportation and\n                communications. Especially when we consider that seven [of the] member countries are landlocked.\u201d<sup\n                        id=\"xref25\"><a href=\"#fn25\">25<\/a><\/sup> The development of improved transport links across the\n                ECO states, such as the Tejen\u2013Mashhad link, highlights the recognition of the need for better\n                connections between member states and also reflects the idea of resurrecting the Silk Road. The old Silk\n                Road constituted several routes over the territory of what are now the ECO states, and resurrecting such\n                an idea naturally has the support of regional leaders, not only in terms of improving regional linkages,\n                but also in terms of adding prestige and reaffirming the region\u2019s position on a trade route of possible\n                global significance.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139739823448208\">An important aspect of the ECO gaining recognition as a functioning regional\n                organisation comes in the development of its relations with other international organisations. As a\n                means of doing so, the ECO has been participating at the UN General Assembly and collaborating with\n                various UN agencies such as the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the UN\n                Development Programme and the UN Population Fund. The ECO has also established contacts with other\n                regional bodies such as the Association of South-East Asian Nations, the Southern Asian Association for\n                Regional Cooperation and the Southern African Development Community. Although the numerous ECO treaties\n                and agreements have provided the organisation with much of the institutionalisation deemed necessary for\n                an integrated regional body, its declaratory record is rather more substantial than its actual tangible\n                achievements. Intra-regional trade levels are low when compared to those of other regional\n                organisations. This is also true regarding Iran\u2019s own levels of trade with Central Asian states, which\n                have historically remained low.<sup id=\"xref26\"><a href=\"#fn26\">26<\/a><\/sup> The most recent figures on\n                Iran\u2013Central Asian trade continue this fairly bleak assessment. In the latest figures released for 2015,\n                taking the five Central Asian states\u2019 economies together, Iran came seventh \u2014 representing 1.9% of\n                overall trade. It fares slightly better as an export market for Central Asian states at 2.9%, while\n                imports from Iran are just 1.1%. Central Asia\u2019s trade is dominated by China, Russia and the European\n                Union. Iran also compares badly with Turkey, which takes up 5.6% of Central Asia\u2019s overall trade.<sup\n                        id=\"xref27\"><a href=\"#fn27\">27<\/a><\/sup> One of the main limitations regarding economic\n                integration is that most of the ECO countries are primary product and commodity exporters, and as such,\n                their economies are more competitive than complementary.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139739823387488\">Tensions also remain between member states on certain issues such as the Caspian\n                Sea, and Iran has expressed concern in the past about Azerbaijan\u2019s relations with the United States,\n                allowing American penetration into the region. During the mid-1990s, the ECO threatened to unravel after\n                Uzbekistan accused Iran of trying to politicise the organisation by using its summit meetings as a\n                platform from which to launch attacks against America and Israel.<sup id=\"xref28\"><a href=\"#fn28\">28<\/a><\/sup>\n                Further cooperation within the ECO is also hampered by a lack of real commitment by some of the member\n                states; Turkey, for example, has a long-standing ambition to become part of the European Union, which,\n                therefore, means that the ECO is not a priority for their government. Iran, on the other hand, has been\n                keen to promote the ECO where it can. With the permanent secretariat being located in Tehran, and Iran\u2019s\n                own geographical location, Iran sees itself as something of a hub for the ECO. The location of key ECO\n                institutions in Tehran, such as the group\u2019s secretariat, reflects Iran\u2019s willingness to shoulder\n                responsibility and, perhaps more importantly, cost for them.<sup id=\"xref29\"><a\n                        href=\"#fn29\">29<\/a><\/sup> In addition, the fact that Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Pakistan and\n                Turkey are key US allies, or at least maintain important security relationships with the US, makes it\n                problematic for Iran\u2019s attempts to push its regional agenda within the framework of the ECO.\n                Furthermore, the various bilateral and multilateral agreements that are being inked by China across the\n                region, particularly as part of its Silk Road\u2013inspired One Belt, One Road initiative, mean that the ECO\n                faces a challenge in maintaining relevance in a rapidly developing region. What it did show throughout\n                the 1990s and the early 2000s, however, was that Iran was willing to put time and effort into a regional\n                grouping that demonstrated its ability to act in a pragmatic and rational manner in the region. It may\n                be that this will pay-off as the Islamic Republic integrates further into the global economy, and new\n                forums (or resurrection of old\/moribund ones) are sought for increased cooperation.<\/p><\/div>\n        <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139739823401792\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">\n            Pipelines<\/h4>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139739823407792\">Pipeline routes constitute a \u201ccentral issue in the regions geopolitics,\u201d<sup\n                    id=\"xref30\"><a href=\"#fn30\">30<\/a><\/sup> with American interests in the region historically\n                dictating that any routes should avoid the Islamic Republic, despite Iran offering the shortest route to\n                the world ocean for Caspian resources, which are essentially landlocked. To counter this, Iran has made\n                what Dekmejian and Simonian<sup id=\"xref31\"><a href=\"#fn31\">31<\/a><\/sup> describe as \u201ccreative moves\u201d to\n                circumvent American attempts to exclude it from Caspian energy deals. This involves linking the Caspian\n                to Tehran, then secondly Tehran to Isfahan and finally from Isfahan to the Persian Gulf through flow\n                reversal of existing pipelines and the construction of missing links. Iran has also been involved in\n                small-scale oil-swap deals with Kazakhstan, whereby Kazakh oil is shipped across the Caspian to supply\n                Iran\u2019s populous northern regions, while Iranian oil from its southern fields is shipped to world markets\n                on behalf of Kazakhstan.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139739823424288\">As the only Central Asian state with which it shares a land border, and also as\n                home to some of the region\u2019s largest natural gas reserves, Turkmenistan has been a key focus for\n                Iran.<sup id=\"xref32\"><a href=\"#fn32\">32<\/a><\/sup> In 1997, Iran funded the construction of the\n                Korpedzhe\u2013Kord\u2013Kuy gas pipeline, allowing delivery of Turkmen gas to northern Iran. A second pipeline,\n                the Dauletabad\u2013Sarakhs\u2013Khangiran pipeline, was opened in 2010, which allows Turkmen gas to reach markets\n                in Turkey and Europe via Iran, thus, reducing its dependency on Russian pipelines. Despite Iran\u2013Turkmen\n                relations being broadly positive in tone, something that arguably is helped by Turkmenistan\u2019s position\n                of permanent neutrality, ties have been occasionally problematic. Relations cooled after Sapurmat\n                Niyazov\u2019s death in 2007, and gas supplies to northern Iran were cut in 2007\u20132008, though the partnership\n                was renewed in 2009 following tensions between the Turkmen government and Gazprom.<sup id=\"xref33\"><a\n                        href=\"#fn33\">33<\/a><\/sup> Turkmenistan also has sights on further export diversification via the\n                so-called TAPI pipeline route (Turkmenistan\u2013Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan\u2013India). Indeed, some have argued that\n                recent lifting of Iran sanctions may stimulate renewed urgency on this from Turkmenistan,<sup\n                        id=\"xref34\"><a href=\"#fn34\">34<\/a><\/sup> as India and Pakistan seek to deepen their economic and\n                hydrocarbon relationships with Iran. Therefore, in addition to cooperative endeavours, one can see a\n                possible competitive element also coming into play in light of the lifting of sanctions.<\/p><\/div>\n        <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139739823440288\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Caspian\n            Sea<\/h4>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139739823372576\">The fact that the Caspian is rich in oil and natural gas reserves adds greater\n                weight to the need for littoral states to agree on how it should be divided. Oil production began in the\n                Baku area of Azerbaijan in the mid-19th century, and by the turn of the 20th century, it had become a\n                major supplier of oil to the world market. Caspian oil was also critical to the industrialisation of\n                Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union. Although the importance of the Azerbaijani fields steadily\n                decreased over the course of the 20th century, significant oil deposits have since been discovered in\n                the north of the Caspian. The break-up of the Soviet Union led to five separate states<sup\n                        id=\"xref35\"><a href=\"#fn35\">35<\/a><\/sup> contesting the sea\u2019s status as opposed to its previous\n                position as an almost entirely Soviet-controlled lake. This status had its roots in the Treaties of\n                Rasht (1729), Gulistan (1813) and Turkmenchai (1828) between the then Russian and Persian Empires, which\n                failed to establish any kind of boundary for the Caspian. Further treaties between Iran and the Soviet\n                Union in 1921, 1935 and 1940 formed the basis of Iran\u2019s position on the Caspian following the\n                dissolution of the USSR, and they are often invoked by Iran when it feels that negotiations over the\n                sea\u2019s legal status may reduce its part of the Caspian to less than it was during Soviet times.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139739823410752\">The Caspian\u2019s legal status has remained undetermined due to the \u201cpeculiarity of\n                its geographical location and the clashing geopolitical and economic interests of the riparian\n                states.\u201d<sup id=\"xref36\"><a href=\"#fn36\">36<\/a><\/sup> In short, there are two main proposals, either\n                division of the Sea into national sectors or joint management as a condominium. The former option gives\n                rise to further problems, as a range of opposing options have been proposed as a method of division.\n                Iran initially favoured the condominium approach, as economic interests and cooperation were the\n                prevailing current in its relations with the Caspian states. However, in 1997, a more political-security\n                stance was taken, and Iran moved towards a position in favour of division.<sup id=\"xref37\"><a\n                        href=\"#fn37\">37<\/a><\/sup> Since 1991, the position of the littoral states in relation to the\n                Caspian\u2019s legal status has varied. In negotiations, Iran has campaigned for an equal division and was\n                initially joined in this respect by Russia. However, Russia has since changed its position and chosen to\n                act bilaterally instead, drawing up agreements with Kazakhstan (1998) and Azerbaijan (2001), dividing up\n                the sea bed and its resources into national sectors, while its waters remain under joint\n                supervision.<sup id=\"xref38\"><a href=\"#fn38\">38<\/a><\/sup> These national sector divisions are based on\n                factors such as the length of each countries\u2019 coastline, and if such factors are applied to the rest of\n                the Caspian, they would leave Iran with far less than the 20% it had originally hoped for. In terms of\n                resource potential in its southern reaches, Iran\u2019s oil deposits in the region are largely unexplored and\n                underdeveloped<sup id=\"xref39\"><a href=\"#fn39\">39<\/a><\/sup>; however, Griffiths argues that Iran is not\n                under economic pressure to resolve the boundary issue because it has greater sources of oil and gas\n                elsewhere on its territory and in the Persian Gulf.<sup id=\"xref40\"><a href=\"#fn40\">40<\/a><\/sup>\n                Furthermore, the Iranian part of the Caspian is deep, making any development offshore difficult and\n                expensive.<sup id=\"xref41\"><a href=\"#fn41\">41<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139739823422064\">There have also been contentious issues between the littoral states, with\n                Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan disputing ownership of the Kyapaz\/Serdar field and Iran also disputing\n                certain Azerbaijani claims to possible oil fields in the southern Caspian. Iran is also wary of\n                Azerbaijan, allowing American firms into an area that is not yet fully demarcated. Indeed, according to\n                Alieva,<sup id=\"xref42\"><a href=\"#fn42\">42<\/a><\/sup> Azerbaijan was the leading actor amongst Caspian\n                littoral states to invite in western interests to the region. In the light of the\n                Russia\u2013Azerbaijan\u2013Kazakhstan agreements, it could be argued that Iran finds itself isolated, as Turkmen\n                support cannot always be counted on due to that country\u2019s historically vacillating position on the\n                issue.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139739823456512\">It is with the major geopolitical upheaval that came with the dissolution of the\n                Soviet Union and the general move towards greater regional cooperation in mind that Iran has been keen\n                to sponsor a Caspian Sea Cooperation Organisation. Wrangling over key issues such as legal status (and\n                subsequent division of resources) can be seen as harming the prospects for any kind of Caspian regional\n                initiative. However, such issues highlight the importance of a forum, in which such grievances can be\n                discussed and, perhaps, solved.<sup id=\"xref43\"><a href=\"#fn43\">43<\/a><\/sup> Also, Iran is still looking\n                to keep American interests in the region in check, and this is something that it shares with the\n                Caspian\u2019s major power Russia and can be seen in its support for Russia\u2019s \u201cCASFOR\u201d (Naval force of\n                Caspian States) initiative, despite having previously been in favour of demilitarisation of the sea.<sup\n                        id=\"xref44\"><a href=\"#fn44\">44<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139739823377360\">Over the years, Iran has been keen to implement the so-called International\n                North\u2013South Transport Corridor via the Caspian Sea and Iran as a means of linking Indian ports with\n                Russia. This would involve improving transport links and infrastructure, and although there have been\n                attempts to initiate concrete plans since the late 1990s,<sup id=\"xref45\"><a href=\"#fn45\">45<\/a><\/sup>\n                progress had been slow. Iran\u2019s return to global energy markets following the JCPOA has helped\n                reinvigorate the scheme, with the active participation of Russia, Azerbaijan and Iran in talks\n                throughout 2016 and a tri-lateral summit taking place in Baku in August. All sides agreed to work\n                towards reducing existing tariff barriers and carrying out improvements in rail and port infrastructure\n                to facilitate the corridor.<sup id=\"xref46\"><a href=\"#fn46\">46<\/a><\/sup> The scheme could also pave the\n                way for further progress on negotiations over the Caspian Sea\u2019s legal regime, as Iran and Azerbaijan\n                build mutual confidence through deepening economic ties. Progress is now being made on the Caspian\n                issue, with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov subsequently stating in talks with Iranian foreign\n                minister Mohamad-Javad Zarif that an agreement was likely to be signed at the Astana Caspian summit in\n                2017.<sup id=\"xref47\"><a href=\"#fn47\">47<\/a><\/sup> Subsequent to this announcement, the five littoral\n                states\u2019 most recent meeting in Tehran produced some preliminary agreements,<sup id=\"xref48\"><a\n                        href=\"#fn48\">48<\/a><\/sup> with Zarif stressing the necessity of protecting the Caspian\u2019s marine\n                environment,<sup id=\"xref49\"><a href=\"#fn49\">49<\/a><\/sup> and thus, an agreement is now looking more\n                likely than at any time since the break-up of the Soviet Union.<\/p><\/div>\n        <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139739823348992\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Security\n            cooperation<\/h4>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139739823357296\">In terms of military security issues, Iran\u2019s restraint and constructive attitude\n                in Central Asia and the Caucasus, regarding the Tajikistan and Nagorno-Karrabakh conflicts in the 1990s,\n                helped improve its international image, and this can be seen in part as helping lay the basis for\n                further cooperation with Iran as a reliable international partner to the Central Asian republics. As\n                previously noted, Iran\u2019s relationship with Russia, and its position as a key arms supplier, has helped\n                determine Iran\u2019s strategy in the region. Iran has historically been quiet on security issues in the\n                wider Eurasian region that might be seen as chiming with its Islamist character. It has offered little\n                in the way of criticism towards Russia and China\u2019s own Muslim separatists in the north Caucasus and\n                Xinjiang, respectively. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) provides an interesting example of a\n                regional grouping that has ostensible security priorities but actually serves a wider geostrategic\n                purpose for Iran as an aspiring member. Allison<sup id=\"xref50\"><a href=\"#fn50\">50<\/a><\/sup> sees the\n                SCO as the most inclusive and prominent regional consultative framework within a security dimension, and\n                the SCO\u2019s precursor organisation, the Shanghai Five, did have mutual security priorities in terms of\n                joint counterterrorism activities, which continued to be held up as an SCO priority in its early years,\n                post-9\/11. However, it could be argued that security concerns are more of a rhetorical feature, with\n                them being given lip service and held up as a key mutual interests by SCO member states, rather than any\n                concrete initiatives. Indeed, Song<sup id=\"xref51\"><a href=\"#fn51\">51<\/a><\/sup> has highlighted how some\n                analysts \u201cagree with the official claim by SCO members that this regional organisation is a\n                nontraditional security regime,\u201d while others define it as a \u201cbloc of authoritarian states confronting\n                Western influence.\u201d<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139739823903824\">The SCO can be seen as promoting greater multipolarity, acting as a possible\n                counterweight to American unilateralism, particularly in the international climate that followed the\n                events of 11 September 2001 and the subsequent War on Terror. China and Russia are especially keen on\n                emphasising this balancing aspect of the SCO, but the Central Asian states are also happy to continue\n                their own multivectored approach, maintaining their own bilateral relations with the United States.\n                While Beijing and Moscow both hold similar views on the SCO as a balance to American influence in\n                Central Asia, the Central Asian republics can also view the SCO as a means of balancing Russian and\n                Chinese interests against each other. An interesting development regarding Iranian\u2013Central Asian\n                relations came in the granting of observer status to Iran at the 5th of July, 2005, SCO summit in\n                Astana, Kazakhstan.<sup id=\"xref52\"><a href=\"#fn52\">52<\/a><\/sup> Though Iran\u2019s relations with the\n                Central Asian region have been mainly defined in terms of economic cooperation, it has been closely\n                monitoring the SCO activities since its foundation,<sup id=\"xref53\"><a href=\"#fn53\">53<\/a><\/sup> viewing\n                it as a useful bulwark against American intentions in the region. Up until now, further cooperation has\n                been stymied by the clause inserted after 10th SCO summit in Tashkent in 2010, which stated new\n                applicants cannot be under international sanctions.<sup id=\"xref54\"><a href=\"#fn54\">54<\/a><\/sup> With\n                the sanctions now being removed, the upgrading of Iran\u2019s status in the SCO is now a more viable\n                possibility, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov offering his support for Tehran\u2019s full\n                membership.<sup id=\"xref55\"><a href=\"#fn55\">55<\/a><\/sup> It is, therefore, in the wider, geostrategic\n                sense that the SCO acts as a useful potential alliance for Iran, but it is an organisation in which its\n                member states have differing priorities. It is more in the symbolic rather than concrete areas of actual\n                security cooperation that the SCO, and Iran\u2019s potential membership of it, is of significance.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139739823899312\">Regarding the Caspian Sea, Allison and Jonson<sup id=\"xref56\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn56\">56<\/a><\/sup> discuss how the littoral states could constitute a \u201csecurity complex.\u201d<sup\n                    id=\"xref57\"><a href=\"#fn57\">57<\/a><\/sup> This is because their shared economic concerns regarding\n                the exploitation of resources and the increased economic interaction that would come about from this\n                could move in cooperative or conflictual directions. For example, the long-standing Iranian and Russian\n                concern with American interests in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan may actually help foster greater\n                cooperation. Also, the Kazakh leadership are unlikely to want to antagonise Russia by blocking any moves\n                by Russia to reduce American influence in the region. However, for the time being at least, Azerbaijan\n                and Kazakhstan would prefer to keep their options open regarding American interests in the Caspian\u2019s\n                resources, while at the same time seeking not to duly antagonise Russia. Turkmenistan\u2019s permanent\n                neutrality makes it a reluctant partner in regional groupings, particularly those with a security\n                dimension, and it prefers to deal bilaterally. Its relations with Iran are increasingly important for\n                both countries, and further cooperation would serve Iran\u2019s interests well in pursuing a broader Central\n                Asian strategy, with Turkmenistan being the only Central Asian state with which Iran shares a land\n                border.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139739823352432\">The lack of regionalism in the Middle East facilitates a greater desire on Iran\u2019s\n                part to move towards a regional order\/grouping with Central Asia.<sup id=\"xref58\"><a href=\"#fn58\">58<\/a><\/sup>\n                In terms of security, some in Iran, such as the former deputy foreign minister for research and\n                training, Abbas Maleki, saw the collapse of the Soviet Union as creating a new subsystem incorporating\n                Iran and Central Asia. Maleki saw Iran moving away from its position on the periphery of an\n                Arab-dominated Middle Eastern security complex towards a Central Asian one.<sup id=\"xref59\"><a\n                        href=\"#fn59\">59<\/a><\/sup> What is particularly interesting now is that arguments such as this on\n                Iran\u2019s place in the regional security picture (that were being offered just after the Central Asian\n                states gained independence)<sup id=\"xref60\"><a href=\"#fn60\">60<\/a><\/sup> are potentially now more likely\n                than ever. This fits with the wider picture of a resurrection of previously moribund schemes and ideas\n                involving Iran and Central Asia that now appear to be more realistic than at any time since the collapse\n                of the Soviet Union.<\/p><\/div>\n        <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139739827926464\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Cultural\n            diplomacy<\/h4>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139739824558928\">Iran has attempted a form of pragmatic cultural diplomacy in the region through a\n                number of avenues both bilaterally and within existing organisational frameworks. Although there is no\n                space to give a full treatment of this issue here, which has also been covered elsewhere,<sup\n                        id=\"xref61\"><a href=\"#fn61\">61<\/a><\/sup> it is of note to this article as the cultural links\n                form a key part of the Iranian geopolitical imagination. It is these softer links that are used by Iran\n                to emphasise its closeness and act as a basis for further cooperation. Within the ECO, the Islamic\n                Republic\u2019s leaders are also keen to stress the cultural links between member states perhaps more than\n                others, who prefer to view the ECO as a purely economic grouping. As part of its strategy of promoting\n                regionalism through the ECO, Iran has been a keen advocate of drawing on the cultural and historical\n                links it shares with the region. The establishment of a dedicated ECO Cultural Institute gave Iran\n                further opportunities to promote a cultural agenda within the organisation,<sup id=\"xref62\"><a\n                        href=\"#fn62\">62<\/a><\/sup> with a focus on shared literary figures and cultural traditions, such\n                as the celebration of the Persian New Year, <i>Nowruz<\/i>, across the region. There is naturally a focus\n                on Islam in Iran\u2019s cultural diplomacy too. However, this is pitched in the unifying feature of the\n                religion in its broadest sense, and the Islamic Republic is cognisant of the secular sensitivities of\n                Central Asia\u2019s rulers. Iran has no real sway among the region\u2019s Islamists who have historically drawn\n                their inspiration from Saudi Arabia and Wahhabism. As a fellow Persian-speaking nation, Tajikistan has\n                naturally formed the focus of Iran\u2019s cultural diplomacy towards Central Asia, and although that country\n                has been broadly receptive to developing this relationship, it has not been without the occasional\n                hiccup,<sup id=\"xref63\"><a href=\"#fn63\">63<\/a><\/sup> based on concern about Tehran moving closer to\n                Tajik Islamists. Iran has also sought to develop bilateral cultural links with Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan\n                and Kyrgyzstan; however, it has struggled to develop any such links with Uzbekistan on account of their\n                historically problematic diplomatic relationship.<sup id=\"xref64\"><a href=\"#fn64\">64<\/a><\/sup><\/p><\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139739823895248\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a>\n\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Conclusion<\/h3>\n\n        <p id=\"idm139739823894448\">This article has highlighted how Central Asia occupies a significant place in Iranian\n            geopolitical thinking. It is a region of several different areas of concern to the Islamic Republic, ranging\n            from developing economic ties to security and cultural cooperation. Iran, therefore, places a great deal of\n            importance on Central Asia, which is further enhanced by its perception of a deep and long-standing\n            historical and cultural relationship with the region. Added to this is the geographic proximity and\n            opportunities afforded by acting as a gateway state, both to and from Central Asia, along with increased\n            Chinese investment as part of its new Silk Road\u2013inspired One Belt, One Road initiative. Central Asia helps\n            develop further connections between Iran and China too, and the sense of reinvigorating an old trading route\n            in the form of a new Silk Road not only speaks of the deep historical rootedness of both states\u2019\n            geopolitical imaginaries, but also speaks of the pragmatic realism of modern international relations.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm139739824555072\">Since independence Iran\u2019s approach to Central Asia is one that has been the domain of\n            pragmatism not often focused on by the West. For 25 years, Iran has regularly attempted to enhance its\n            standing through pursuing regionalist initiatives, but with limited success to date. This was due to the\n            recent independence of these states and an Iran that was too often viewed as an international pariah \u2014 which\n            found its articulation in the successive crippling sanctions regimes against it which stymied further\n            economic development. Although Iran has been keen on promoting regional groupings, such as the ECO and SCO,\n            the Central Asian states, while participating in such ventures, have remained steadfast in their desire for\n            a \u201cmultivectored\u201d foreign policy. This has come about as a result of their still relatively recently gained\n            independence, which gives them a desire to pursue independent foreign policy objectives. As such, there is a\n            questionable commitment to these initiatives, especially if they are seen as providing cover for another\n            power to assert its hegemony over the region, with the result being that there has been much in the way of\n            declaration and little in the way of substance.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm139739823892832\">Now, however, Iran has the opportunity to finally pursue these dreams of greater\n            engagement more realistically. One can expect greater movement in terms of Iran\u2019s closer integration with\n            the region following the JCPOA and subsequent lifting of the sanctions regime. As Iran takes what it has\n            always seen as its rightful place in key international and regional organisations, the benefits of its\n            re-integration will likely stimulate further engagement.

In 2014, the two nations signed an unprecedented gas deal worth US$400\u00a0billion. In May 2015, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping agreed to coordinate the Moscow-led EEU with China\u2019s Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB). Following these developments, authors and journalists heralded a new era in Sino-Russian relations in which the two nations would consolidate their forces to counter a US-led unipolar world. However, the nature of the relationship between China and Russia, the prospects for closer cooperation between the two nations, and the feasibility of integrating the two grand Eurasian projects are topics of fierce debate. This article maintains that while a consensus between Moscow and Beijing with regard to post-Cold War US unilateralism and their convergent interests have pushed China and Russia to cooperate on a range of global and regional issues, relations between the two Eurasian neighbours are complex and multi-faceted and are far from forming an anti-US bloc. Furthermore, the abstract nature of China\u2019s Silk Road initiative and a number of significant obstacles make the feasibility of integration between the two projects a complicated task. Issues explored by this article include the development of mechanisms and agreement on a format for cooperation between the nations involved; the solution of practical issues such as rail gauges and corruption in the region; the prospects for an \u201cequal partnership\u201d in Sino-Russian relations and Moscow\u2019s predicament with regards to its position as \u201cjunior partner\u201d in Eurasia; and last but not least, the ever-growing threat of Islamic fundamentalism and regional security.<\/p><\/div>\n",

In 2014, the two nations signed the gas deal worth US$400\u00a0billion, and then on 8 May 2015 at a meeting in Moscow, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping agreed to integrate their two projects: the SREB and the EEU. The agreement will \u201ccoordinate political institutions, investment funds, development banks, currency regimes, and financial systems\u2014all to serve a vast free trade area linking China with Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.\u201d<sup id=\"xref1\"><a href=\"#fn1\">1<\/a><\/sup> China was the first country to receive Russia\u2019s S-400 Triumf air and missile defence systems. In Russia, pundits close to the Kremlin have argued that following these events, Russia and China have entered a new era of strategic partnership which will lead to the formation of a new \u201cGreater Eurasia\u201d macro-bloc, consisting of \u201cChina, Russia, Kazakhstan, Iran, and possibly India.\u201d<sup id=\"xref2\"><a href=\"#fn2\">2<\/a><\/sup> This macro-bloc will oppose the US-led international order, resulting in a return to a bipolar world order.<sup id=\"xref3\"><a href=\"#fn3\">3<\/a><\/sup> A report published by the Valdai Club asserts that Eurasian economic integration, led by Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus, and the SREB projects, is the main driving force behind the transformation of \u201cCentral Eurasia\u201d into a \u201czone of joint development.\u201d<sup id=\"xref4\"><a href=\"#fn4\">4<\/a><\/sup> Nonetheless, the nature of the relationship between China and Russia prospects for closer cooperation between the two nations over formation of an anti-US bloc and the feasibility of integrating the two grand Eurasian projects are the subject of fierce debate. The aim of this article is threefold: (1) to discuss the foundations of Sino-Russian rapprochement since 1991 and explore the nature of the relationship; (2) to examine the aims and objectives of China\u2019s One Belt One Road and Russia\u2019s EEU; and (3) to assess the feasibility of combining the SREB and the EEU by exploring the major challenges and problems facing integration.<\/p><p id=\"idm139941997955776\">Section 2 explores the foundations of Sino-Russian rapprochement in the post-Cold War world. The continuously improving relationship between Moscow and Beijing since 1991 rests on a number of issues, including economic complementarity, opposition to Western, and particularly US, hegemony in the international arena, protection of the sovereignty of non-western states, a shared interest in the strategically important Central Asian region and coordination and bilateral support in the UN Security Council. More importantly, neither Russia nor China is keen on a world dominated by a US which consistently disregards their national interests in the international arena. Exploring convergence in Sino-Russian interests and their common views on the nature of international relations, this section maintains that while post-Cold War US unilateralism has pushed China and Russia to cooperate on a range of global and regional issues, the two nations have reasons far beyond opposition to the West for continuing their fruitful and stable collaborative partnership in Eurasia.<\/p><p id=\"idm139941997962624\">Section 3 reviews the main academic narratives which explain the nature of the relationship between the two countries. Engaging with arguments on the nature of the Sino-Russian relationship and recent developments between Moscow and Beijing put forward by leading experts in the field such as Bobo Lo, Marcin Kazmarski, Iurii \u041c. Galenovich, Alexander Lukin, and Mikhail L. Titarenko, this section argues that the complex and multi-layered relationship between Moscow and Beijing cannot be defined in simple phrases such as <i>Strategic Partnership<\/i> or <i>Marriage of Convenience<\/i>.<\/p><p id=\"idm139941997978176\">Section 4 investigates the two Eurasian projects: China\u2019s One Belt and One Road (Belt and Road) and the Moscow-led EEU. This section provides an overview of China\u2019s initiative, seeking to explore the main economic and geopolitical motivations behind Beijing\u2019s attractive vision, while also providing a brief overview of the EEU.<\/p><p id=\"idm139941999084240\">Section 5 seeks to analyse the feasibility of integration between the two projects, identifying a number of factors which must be explored if this integration is to be realized. These include developing road maps containing more information on how the SREB will be implemented, creating mechanisms and institutions for collaborating and agreeing on a format of cooperation to suit all nations, discussing whether Russia would be willing to take the role of junior partner, and determining how to curb regional security threats and contain growing extremist Wahhabi influence.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139941997845088\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">The foundations of Sino-Russian rapprochement in the post-Cold War World<\/h3><p id=\"idm139941997877584\">Sino-Russian relations, which have gradually developed and improved since 1991, can currently be seen as \u201ca model for how major countries can manage their differences and cooperate in ways that strengthen the international system.\u201d<sup id=\"xref5\"><a href=\"#fn5\">5<\/a><\/sup> This section elaborates on the foundations for this consistent convergence\/rapprochement between the two Eurasian nations. First of all, since 1991, the two nations have managed to overcome their historical grievances towards each other by constructing new narratives on how the two nations view each other. For instance, from Russia\u2019s perspective, China was one of the very few powers that did not celebrate the disintegration of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. More importantly, there is a perception among the Russian political elite that China did not humiliate Russians during the 1990s,<sup id=\"xref6\"><a href=\"#fn6\">6<\/a><\/sup> refraining from participating in the concerted patronization of post-Soviet Russia in lecturing it on how to behave at home and in the international arena.<sup id=\"xref7\"><a href=\"#fn7\">7<\/a><\/sup> Indeed, since 1991, China has treated Russia with respect, being very careful not to humiliate its former adversary.<sup id=\"xref8\"><a href=\"#fn8\">8<\/a><\/sup> According to Mikhail L. Titarenko, in the 1990s, China was the only country that continued to see Russia as a great power. According to Russia\u2019s political elite, China is the only major power in the international arena that welcomes Russia\u2019s desperate attempts to regain its great power status in the contemporary world, unlike the West where, as far as the leadership in Kremlin is concerned, a \u201cCold War mentality\u201d still prevails.<sup id=\"xref9\"><a href=\"#fn9\">9<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139941997972784\">Moscow and Beijing have also consistently supported each other in combating domestic problems such as separatism and terrorism.<sup id=\"xref10\"><a href=\"#fn10\">10<\/a><\/sup> Russia is the only power among the key players in the international arena which has continuously and consistently supported China\u2019s struggle against Uyghur separatism, as well as Beijing\u2019s stance on Taiwan, Tibet, and its territorial disputes in the South China Sea.<sup id=\"xref11\"><a href=\"#fn11\">11<\/a><\/sup> On the other hand, China has shown support for Russia\u2019s Chechen policy ever since the conflict unfolded and has never criticized Moscow\u2019s conduct of the repressive and bloody war in its Muslim populated region.<sup id=\"xref12\"><a href=\"#fn12\">12<\/a><\/sup> Moreover, as Vladimir Putin once noted, Russia and China have \u201ca lot of converging interests on the international arena, and this also concerns stabilization of the situation on the international arena.\u201d<sup id=\"xref13\"><a href=\"#fn13\">13<\/a><\/sup> This was evident when North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO\u2019s) bombing of Yugoslavia and the United States\u2019 unilateral decision to invade Iraq resulted in further convergence between Moscow and Beijing. Both nations believe in the idea of a multi-polar world order, maintaining that all countries have the right to pursue their own interests and to decide for themselves how to approach regional and global development. Thus, the political elites of both nations have always criticized the Democratic Universalist view and were critical of the interventionist \u201cFreedom Agenda\u201d policy imposed by the George W. Bush administration in the 2000s. Russian and Chinese officials have stated on many occasions that Bush\u2019s \u201cWar on Terror\u201d failed, while the invasion of Iraq actually increased the worldwide threat from terrorism. They also believe that George W. Bush\u2019s policies led to the \u201ccoloured revolutions\u201d in countries such as Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and Ukraine (twice).<sup id=\"xref14\"><a href=\"#fn14\">14<\/a><\/sup> They are sceptical about the international community, which they consider \u201cUnited States-centred\u201d<sup id=\"xref15\"><a href=\"#fn15\">15<\/a><\/sup> and are extremely critical of the West\u2019s use of non-governmental organizations (NGO) to interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign nations.<\/p><p id=\"idm139941997902528\">One of the main platforms for collaboration between Russia and China has been the United Nations, where their representatives have several times blocked calls by the US and the European Union for \u201chumanitarian interventions.\u201d In 2007, China and Russia initiated a double veto<sup id=\"xref16\"><a href=\"#fn16\">16<\/a><\/sup> against the Security Council\u2019s demands to \u201cend political repression and human rights violations\u201d in Myanmar.<sup id=\"xref17\"><a href=\"#fn17\">17<\/a><\/sup> Beijing and Russia also rejected numerous calls by the West and the US to join the \u201cinternational community\u201d in their quest to punish Iran by means of sanctions and embargos for what they claimed were Tehran\u2019s attempts to create nuclear weapons.<sup id=\"xref18\"><a href=\"#fn18\">18<\/a><\/sup> In 2008, Russia and China cast a double veto to block a UN resolution calling for an arms embargo on Zimbabwe and financial and travel restrictions on its president Robert Mugabe and 13 other regime leaders. Between 2011 and 2014, China and Russia coordinated to veto four separate UN Security Council resolutions on Syria. In 2012, Russia and China vetoed a resolution that would have threatened sanctions against the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. Similarly, in 2014, the two countries vetoed another UN resolution which would have referred the Syrian situation to the International Criminal Court for possible prosecution of crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by the Syrian army since the war erupted in 2011. Beijing also supported Moscow\u2019s military intervention in Syria in 2015, while the previous year Beijing abstained from criticizing Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. Considering China\u2019s sensitivity to separatism and its emphasis on international law, this came as a surprise to many experts and commentators.<\/p><p id=\"idm139941997917984\">Regional security is another area where the two countries\u2019 interests increasingly converge, as is particularly evident in Central Asia. The two nations have closely cooperated in the region since the mid-1990s, when the Shanghai Five summit, later to become the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), was first convened. Since the early 2000s, numerous commentators and scholars have argued that China and Russia are in a state of fierce competition over the Central Asian region. Marcin Kaczmarski challenges this notion, claiming that in fact a \u201cnew status quo has emerged\u201d in the region<sup id=\"xref19\"><a href=\"#fn19\">19<\/a><\/sup> and believing that both China and Russia have emerged as winners in Central Asia. China has secured access to hydrocarbons and economic expansion, while Russia still holds \u201cdominant positions in the areas of politics and security.\u201d<sup id=\"xref20\"><a href=\"#fn20\">20<\/a><\/sup> China accepts the Kremlin\u2019s claim that Central Asia lies in Russia\u2019s sphere of influence, and unlike the West has consistently recognized Russia\u2019s legitimate interests in the region and post-Soviet space in general. China has not shown any concern about Russia\u2019s military presence in the region. On the contrary, Chinese officials have often reiterated that Beijing has several reasons for being interested in Russia\u2019s support and military influence, including regarding China\u2019s battle with separatism and Islamic extremism and checking Western influence in the region.<sup id=\"xref21\"><a href=\"#fn21\">21<\/a><\/sup> Thus, China has recognized Russia\u2019s political and military primacy in Central Asia, while Russia accepts China\u2019s economic supremacy.<sup id=\"xref22\"><a href=\"#fn22\">22<\/a><\/sup> Russia has also acted as a driving force in East Asia behind a multi-lateral initiative leading to the creation of the so-called six-party format, which tried to solve the nuclear crisis involving North Korea.<sup id=\"xref23\"><a href=\"#fn23\">23<\/a><\/sup> In May 2015, Russia and China conducted a 10-day naval drill in the Mediterranean Sea, demonstrating their combined military abilities to the West in locations traditionally dominated by NATO and far from the Chinese and Russian coastlines.<sup id=\"xref24\"><a href=\"#fn24\">24<\/a><\/sup> In 2015, the Kremlin offered China the opportunity to purchase Russia\u2019s most advanced anti-aircraft missile, the S-400.<sup id=\"xref25\"><a href=\"#fn25\">25<\/a><\/sup> It is thus in the best interests of both nations to continue their hitherto highly successful collaborative partnership in Eurasia and develop \u201ctheir bilateral relations \u2026 to achieve national security and development.\u201d<sup id=\"xref26\"><a href=\"#fn26\">26<\/a><\/sup><\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139941997950656\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">The nature of the Sino-Russian relationship<\/h3><p id=\"idm139941997955504\">The nature of Sino-Russian relations in the post-Cold War era has been one of the major questions to occupy the minds of experts and academics and has been hotly debated in every major text on the topic. Scholars agree that debate has led to two major narratives which explain relations between Moscow and Beijing.<sup id=\"xref27\"><a href=\"#fn27\">27<\/a><\/sup> The first school of thought is the <i>Axis of Convenience<\/i> narrative, coined by Bobo Lo in his influential book published in 2009. In the past, other authors, such as Dmitrii Trenin, have used the similar term <i>Marriage of Convenience<\/i> to explain the nature of partnership between Moscow and Beijing. Rajan Menon, Stephen Blank, Elizabeth Wishnick, Marl\u00e8ne Laruelle, and Andrew C. Kuchins among others represent this camp of scholars and commentators, who often emphasize the instrumental nature of the Sino-Russian relationship. This line of reasoning has become the dominant narrative in the Western academic debate on contemporary Sino-Russian relations.<sup id=\"xref28\"><a href=\"#fn28\">28<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139941997970528\">When discussing the main problematic of the Sino-Russian \u201cstrategic partnership,\u201d the prominent scholars emphasize two related factors: the instrumental nature of the Sino-Russian relationship and the two nations\u2019 approach to the US and the international order. As Bobo Lo notes, \u201cthe inability to value engagement on its own merits\u201d is one of the main limits of Russia\u2019s <i>Turn to the East<\/i> policy.<sup id=\"xref29\"><a href=\"#fn29\">29<\/a><\/sup> In his comprehensive and timely book <i>Russia and the New World Disorder<\/i>, Lo points out that China\u2019s instrumental significance to Moscow was evident during the Ukraine crisis when Vladimir Putin increasingly played the China card against the West.<sup id=\"xref30\"><a href=\"#fn30\">30<\/a><\/sup> The second area where Moscow and Beijing differ is in their attitude to the US and the Washington-dominated international order. Clearly, the two nations\u2019 approach to the US is the most important difference between Moscow and Beijing. According to Bobo Lo, for China, \u201cAmerica is the only truly indispensable partner, of immeasurably greater importance than Russia.\u201d<sup id=\"xref31\"><a href=\"#fn31\">31<\/a><\/sup> He argues that China has benefitted enormously since the late 1980s from the Washington Consensus and free trade, and unlike Russia, the communist leadership in Beijing does not want to destroy the international system but simply \u201cimprove\u201d it to its own advantage.<sup id=\"xref32\"><a href=\"#fn32\">32<\/a><\/sup> Bobo Lo argues that Moscow and Beijing differ in their vision of the international system, with Moscow seeing a tripolar United States\u2013China\u2013Russia world order, while Beijing anticipates a bipolar international system dominated by the US and China.<sup id=\"xref33\"><a href=\"#fn33\">33<\/a><\/sup> Similarly, Marcin Kazmarski points out that Beijing is interested in a stable and \u201cconducive\u201d international environment where Beijing can proceed with economic expansion, while Moscow has proved itself to \u201cthrive on insecurity and instability.\u201d<sup id=\"xref34\"><a href=\"#fn34\">34<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139941997904000\">While the arguments put forward by the leading scholars mentioned above are largely accurate, there are several minor caveats in their claims. First, they attach little importance to the consequences of Moscow and Beijing\u2019s irritation at feeling encircled by the military bases of the United States and its NATO allies. For instance since 2001, US unilateralism and its growing influence in the region have been among the major factors which have led to Sino-Russian strategic convergence and growing cooperation in the Central Asian arena, including collaborations within the SCO framework. Two nations held a number of unprecedented, large-scale War Games conducted under the auspices of the SCO. During the 2012 SCO summit, Russian and Chinese officials\/leaders have asserted that they oppose the West\u2019s interventionist policy in Syria. Furthermore, they noted that an attack on Iran by the United States and its allies would be considered unacceptable by both Moscow and Beijing. Second, one should not underestimate the ambiguity in the Chinese elites\u2019 perception of US action in the international arena, especially regarding the United States\u2019 role in causing the chaos of crises such as those in the Middle East and Ukraine.<sup id=\"xref35\"><a href=\"#fn35\">35<\/a><\/sup> Chinese officials also resent the \u201cColored Revolutions,\u201d which according to Beijing amount to Western-sponsored <i>coups d\u2019\u00e9tat<\/i> which have overthrown authoritarian regimes around the world and led to chaos and instability. Authoritarian regimes such as those in Central Asia, Africa, and South America can serve as guarantors of their countries\u2019 stability\u2014thereby accommodating the economic activities of Chinese enterprises.<sup id=\"xref36\"><a href=\"#fn36\">36<\/a><\/sup> Finally, neither Bobo Lo nor Marcin Kazmarski elaborates on Moscow\u2019s attempts to destroy the US-led international order or on Moscow\u2019s endeavours to \u201cthrive on insecurity and instability.\u201d It is important to note that these are highly contested issues and largely depend on an author\u2019s political preferences about both the nature of the international order and the roles played by the US and Russia in international politics.<\/p><p id=\"idm139941997928384\">The second school of thought is the <i>Strategic Partnership<\/i> narrative, adopted by a large segment of both Russia\u2019s and China\u2019s expert community, including influential Russian China experts such as Iurii \u041c. Galenovich<sup id=\"xref37\"><a href=\"#fn37\">37<\/a><\/sup> and Mikhail L. Titarenko.<sup id=\"xref38\"><a href=\"#fn38\">38<\/a><\/sup> Unsurprisingly, the political elites in both countries are the major advocates of the <i>Strategic Partnership<\/i> narrative. Some of the areas emphasized by proponents of this school of thought in order to prove that the relationship between Moscow and Beijing is more than a <i>Marriage of Convenience<\/i> are Russian-Chinese energy dialogue and bilateral trade. Energy trade has developed rapidly since Vladimir Putin\u2019s March 2006 visit to Beijing, when the two governments signed four energy cooperation agreements regarding future cooperation in oil, gas, electricity, and nuclear energy.<sup id=\"xref39\"><a href=\"#fn39\">39<\/a><\/sup> In 2009, Moscow and Beijing signed a $100\u00a0billion oil contract. Negotiations over a gas agreement that would make China Russia\u2019s biggest gas consumer continued until 2014 when Russia and China signed the $400\u00a0billion-gas deal mentioned earlier. The long border between Russia and China provides a convenient hub for the transfer of natural resources, which is practically impossible for a third party to access.<sup id=\"xref40\"><a href=\"#fn40\">40<\/a><\/sup> According to Dmitrii Trenin, this is one of China\u2019s main rationales for considering Russia a \u201cgenuine strategic partner,\u201d while other countries are regarded by China as \u201cboth partners and competitors.\u201d<sup id=\"xref41\"><a href=\"#fn41\">41<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139941997980000\">The scholarly and academic community is deeply divided over the nature of Sino-Russian relations. While many commentators and scholars discuss the possibility of a fully fledged alliance between Moscow and Beijing, others argue that a plethora of disagreements and economic rivalry in Central Asia, as well as historical distrust between the former rivals, will always prevent the two from creating an axis.<sup id=\"xref42\"><a href=\"#fn42\">42<\/a><\/sup> The author of this study tends to agree with Fedor Lukyanov, who said that even with a significant set of shared interests, an alliance between Russia and China is impossible as neither is prepared to renounce its interests and adjust itself to the other.<sup id=\"xref43\"><a href=\"#fn43\">43<\/a><\/sup> Indeed, for a genuine strategic partnership or alliance, the two nations would have to comply with each other\u2019s interests. However, at this stage, neither Moscow nor Beijing is prepared to give up its freedom of action and restrain themselves in order to act in the best interests of the other.<sup id=\"xref44\"><a href=\"#fn44\">44<\/a><\/sup><\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139941997940656\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">The grand Eurasian projects: Motivations and objectives<\/h3><p id=\"idm139942002454112\">In the 21st century, every major player in Eurasia has initiated its own integration project: Russia is realizing the EEU; in 2011, the United States announced its \u201cpivot to Asia,\u201d aimed at consolidating an economic bloc through the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the New Silk Road\u2014a proposal to integrate South and Central Asia along the ancient trade route; China responded by initiating the gargantuan Belt and Road initiative, unprecedented in its ambition; India has started planning the Connect Central Asia and Cotton Road policies, instigated as a counterweight to China\u2019s initiative. In the last few years, commentators and experts have debated the nature of these mega projects and their impact on the global geopolitical configuration. The following section investigates the China Silk Road initiative and provides a brief overview of the Moscow-led Eurasian Union, addressing the main question occupying the minds of scholars and experts: why they have been initiated and what they endeavour to achieve.<\/p><p id=\"idm139942002453664\">In 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced plans to realize the gargantuan One Road One Belt project (also Belt and Road), consisting of the SREB and the 21st century Maritime Silk Road (MSR). The former will concentrate on the continental countries of Central Asia and Eastern Europe, while the latter will target the littoral countries of Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, and East Africa. According to official blueprints, the Belt and Road endeavours to connect Asia, Europe, and Africa along five major routes.<sup id=\"xref45\"><a href=\"#fn45\">45<\/a><\/sup> The focus of the SREB will be on (1) linking China to Europe through Central Asia and Russia; (2) connecting China with the Middle East through Central Asia; and (3) bringing together China and Southeast Asia, South Asia, and the Indian Ocean. On the other hand, the MSR will focus on using Chinese coastal ports to (1) link China with Europe through the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean and (2) connect China with the South Pacific Ocean through the South China Sea.<sup id=\"xref46\"><a href=\"#fn46\">46<\/a><\/sup> The main focus of SREB is railroad and railways such as New Eurasian Land Bridge, which aims to connect China to Central Europe through Kazakhstan, Russia, and other parts of Eastern Europe. While experts have speculated that the entire vision as proposed by Xi Jinping would cost an staggering $8\u00a0trillion, the China Development Bank is looking to use a fund of $US890\u00a0billion to invest in 900 projects over the next five years, while the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has received $100\u00a0billion so far and $US40\u00a0billion has been allocated to the national Silk Road Fund.<sup id=\"xref47\"><a href=\"#fn47\">47<\/a><\/sup> Hence, unlike the United States version of the Silk Road project\u2014 announced by Hillary Clinton in 2011\u2014China\u2019s initiative is backed by real funds.<\/p><p id=\"idm139941997959680\">The motivation behind China\u2019s initiative has been fiercely debated among commentators and scholars in Russia and worldwide. In Russia, opinion is divided between Sinophiles, who hold strong positions in the government, and the sceptics whose voices have become increasingly marginalized since Vladimir Putin\u2019s return to the presidency in 2012. Sceptics argue that the real purpose behind China\u2019s plans to spend trillions on infrastructure in these economically uncertain times is to build a strong foundation for future hegemony over Eurasia\u2014as the first step towards global hegemony. On the other hand, Sinophiles in Russia and optimists elsewhere recognize that China is securing access to new markets and sources of energy but argue that if the initiative is realized it will undoubtedly bring economic growth and prosperity to all involved.<\/p><p id=\"idm139941997971504\">Discourse on the topic has postulated a number of equally important and often overlapping reasons for China\u2019s mega project. It is often argued that the economic rationale is paramount\u2014the initiative will boost Chinese exports to \u201cCentral Asia and beyond.\u201d<sup id=\"xref48\"><a href=\"#fn48\">48<\/a><\/sup> Reducing the cost of trade through the initiative\u2019s infrastructure is a major step towards rejuvenating the economy before it runs \u201cout of steam,\u201d replacing its old growth model\u2014which consisted of producing and exporting goods\u2014with the revival of the <i>Pax Mongolica<\/i>.<sup id=\"xref49\"><a href=\"#fn49\">49<\/a><\/sup> Furthermore, economic prosperity in countries along the Belt and Road will result in \u201cgrowing demand for China\u2019s goods and services.\u201d<sup id=\"xref50\"><a href=\"#fn50\">50<\/a><\/sup> Others argue that the initiative is a well-planned, pre-emptive strike before China\u2019s ever-growing economy repeats the fate of other Asian economies such as Japan\u2019s\u2014which entered a long period of stagnation following decades of economic growth. Furthermore, if realized, the initiative secures China\u2019s access to the region\u2019s hydrocarbons. Energy sufficiency is absolutely vital for Beijing to sustain economic growth and control the pollution caused by the use of coal\u2014necessary for the production of electricity and heating.<\/p><p id=\"idm139941997868080\">A number of Russian and American experts such as Alexander Cooley and Timofei Bordachev argue that the end of the infrastructure boom has resulted in excess labour force capacity, meaning that the entire sector specialized in the building of large-scale infrastructure has become underemployed. Furthermore, Chinese cement and steel manufacturers that have supplied the infrastructure boom also need new large-scale projects beyond China. In 2015, China accounted for over 50% of global overcapacity in steel,<sup id=\"xref51\"><a href=\"#fn51\">51<\/a><\/sup> and the US government has consequently blamed Beijing for the 2016 global steel crisis, urging the Chinese steel industry to curb its output.<sup id=\"xref52\"><a href=\"#fn52\">52<\/a><\/sup> Thus, a tremendous number of companies with \u201cextensive experience, technologies, equipment and labor\u201d need to explore new \u201cgeographical boundaries,\u201d such as Central Asia, Iran, and Russia.<sup id=\"xref53\"><a href=\"#fn53\">53<\/a><\/sup> The Belt and Road initiative makes this possible, since most projects associated with the initiative will be completed with China\u2019s own contractors, labour power, and equipment.<\/p><p id=\"idm139941998023136\">Another very important motivation behind the initiative is to encourage economic development in China\u2019s Xinjiang autonomous region.<sup id=\"xref54\"><a href=\"#fn54\">54<\/a><\/sup> The leadership in Beijing has long strived to solve China\u2019s regional [economic] inequalities, especially in its Western regions, which have remained underdeveloped despite three decades of spectacular economic growth. Xinjiang\u2019s economic development has also been among Beijing\u2019s priorities in its endeavour to solve the major problems of its Western provinces, including separatism, radical Islamism and terrorism, ethnic conflict, and underdevelopment.<sup id=\"xref55\"><a href=\"#fn55\">55<\/a><\/sup> For Beijing, the main causes of Uyghur separatism and religious extremism are not ethnic conflict but underdevelopment and poverty.<sup id=\"xref56\"><a href=\"#fn56\">56<\/a><\/sup> According to China\u2019s \u201charmonious society\u201d (hexie shehui) policy, proclaimed by Hu Jintao at the 17th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 2007, there is a direct correlation between security and development.<sup id=\"xref57\"><a href=\"#fn57\">57<\/a><\/sup> In order to develop Xinjiang province as China\u2019s new centre for the oil and gas industry,<sup id=\"xref58\"><a href=\"#fn58\">58<\/a><\/sup> in 2000, Beijing initiated the \u201cGo West\u201d strategy, involving the building of infrastructure that would connect the province \u201cto coastal areas within China as well as to neighbouring states in Central and South Asia.\u201d<sup id=\"xref59\"><a href=\"#fn59\">59<\/a><\/sup> One of the road maps published by the Chinese government in 2015 sets out the aim to \u201cmake good use of Xinjiang\u2019s geographical advantages,\u201d making \u201cit a key transportation, trade, logistics, culture, science, and education center.\u201d<sup id=\"xref60\"><a href=\"#fn60\">60<\/a><\/sup> Hence, the Road and Belt would lead to better wealth distribution and massive investment in local economies and infrastructure, which they hope will fill the gap between underdeveloped continental and more developed maritime regions.<sup id=\"xref61\"><a href=\"#fn61\">61<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139941997886624\">China\u2019s trade in the The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) free trade zone has reached a staggering $400\u00a0billion a year by 2012.<sup id=\"xref62\"><a href=\"#fn62\">62<\/a><\/sup> In comparison, China\u2019s trade with the entire Central Asian region is $40\u00a0billion a year. This means that China is far too dependent on maritime transport routes dominated by the United States and so it is attempting to diversify its import and export routes. Aleksander Gabuev argues that China is afraid that in a crisis Washington may impose a naval blockade in the South China Sea, where the US holds strategic pre-eminence.<sup id=\"xref63\"><a href=\"#fn63\">63<\/a><\/sup> Thus, the ancient \u201cSilk Route(s)\u201d through Central Asia, Iran, and Russia is(are) \u201can alternative to US-controlled oceans.\u201d<sup id=\"xref64\"><a href=\"#fn64\">64<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139941997882848\">Last but not least, the Road and Belt initiative could be used as an effective soft power instrument to promote Chinese interests. Across the continental landmass, from Russian Siberia to India and from Mongolia to Mesopotamia and the Balkans, the term \u201cSilk Road\u201d conjures up positive mythical and poetic feelings, due to its place in local peoples\u2019 culture and traditions. Hence, from a public relations perspective, the name has been chosen at least in part because its appealing image might help to convince Asian states of Beijing\u2019s good intentions and of the profitability of the proposed vision.<sup id=\"xref65\"><a href=\"#fn65\">65<\/a><\/sup> Hopefully, Beijing can use the Belt and Road initiative to promote its foreign policy doctrine of \u201cFive Principles of Peaceful Coexistence,\u201d consisting of \u201cmutual respect for each other\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in each other\u2019s internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.\u201d<sup id=\"xref66\"><a href=\"#fn66\">66<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139941998433136\">The second Eurasian integration project is the Russia-led EEU, which also includes Kazakhstan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, and Armenia as member states. The main aim of this initiative is to regulate economic activity over these territories by eliminating tariff and non-tariff barriers. The EEU has economic and geopolitical objectives. Its economic aims include restoring economic integration in the former Soviet space through free movement of goods, labour, capital, and services in an attempt to compete with China\u2019s economic expansion in the region and counter the influence of other global economic blocs such as the European Union.<sup id=\"xref67\"><a href=\"#fn67\">67<\/a><\/sup> Its geopolitical aims include containing the influence of the US and its allies in the region and maintaining the status quo, which for Russia means preserving secular and authoritarian post-Soviet leaders and ensuring that the region remains within Russia\u2019s sphere of influence. At the moment, a common customer space has been created from Bishkek to Brest, and the citizens of all five member states have equal employment rights across the union.<sup id=\"xref68\"><a href=\"#fn68\">68<\/a><\/sup> The aspiration of the EEU is to follow the model of EU integration and become the next successful supranational entity.<sup id=\"xref69\"><a href=\"#fn69\">69<\/a><\/sup> In contrast to the Chinese initiative, the EEU is a regional integration initiative, operating through supranational and intergovernmental institutions. The Belt and Road, on the other hand, is an abstract vision backed by China\u2019s cash reserves. Moreover, the Russian version is much less ambitious and has suffered several significant setbacks lately<sup id=\"xref70\"><a href=\"#fn70\">70<\/a><\/sup>; the biggest blow to EEU integration was the Maidan Revolution, which made the possibility of Ukraine joining the EEU unrealistic for decades to come.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139941997981792\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Combining the SREB and the EEU: Prospects and challenges<\/h3><p id=\"idm139941998437024\">After the Belt and Road initiative was announced in 2013, Chinese officials were concerned about Russia\u2019s reaction. Beijing feared that Moscow would view the initiative as threatening its area of special influence and react by putting pressure on the leaderships of the Central Asian states to dissuade them from participating.<sup id=\"xref71\"><a href=\"#fn71\">71<\/a><\/sup> Chinese officials were determined to convince Moscow that the SREB was not a threat to Russia although it took over a year of hesitation before the Kremlin decided whether or not China\u2019s initiative threatened Russian interests.<sup id=\"xref72\"><a href=\"#fn72\">72<\/a><\/sup> Finally, on 8 May 2015, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping signed a declaration of cooperation on coordinating the construction of the EEU and the SREB. As demonstrated above, the two projects are completely different in nature and are at different stages of development. The former is an integration process, which operates through supranational and intergovernmental institutions, while the latter is a philosophical vision backed by China\u2019s cash reserves\u2014making integration between the two a complicated task.<\/p><p id=\"idm139941997965808\">Indeed, there are a number of challenges that need to be explored in order to make integration between the SREB and the EEU feasible. First of all, as many have noted, the agreements signed on the Belt and Road, including that initialled by the two presidents on 8 May, consist of vague declarations of intent and political statements.<sup id=\"xref73\"><a href=\"#fn73\">73<\/a><\/sup> The only concrete issue mentioned is the complex matter of establishing a free trade zone, which the agreement postpones to a later date and the formation of a working group on integration of the SREB and EEU.<sup id=\"xref74\"><a href=\"#fn74\">74<\/a><\/sup> Hence, experts in Russia and Central Asia question the project\u2019s implementation process and the feasibility of integration between the SREB and the EEU.<sup id=\"xref75\"><a href=\"#fn75\">75<\/a><\/sup> Even the Chinese officials who were behind the conceptualization of the entire project are not fully aware of how the Belt and Road will be implemented. As pointed out in a report by The Royal Institute of Defense and Security Studies (RUSI), even the article published by The National Development and Reform Commission, entitled \u201cVisions and Actions on Jointly Building Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road,\u201d although laying out an attractive vision, contains limited information on how this rather abstract idea can be materialized.<sup id=\"xref76\"><a href=\"#fn76\">76<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139941999090496\">At this stage, the Kremlin lacks any guarantees that Russia will benefit from the Chinese initiative and from the combination of the SREB and the EEU. Indeed, the roles of Armenia, Belarus, and Russia in the SREB are not yet outlined clearly.<sup id=\"xref77\"><a href=\"#fn77\">77<\/a><\/sup> Interestingly, none of the infrastructure projects and maps made public by Chinese officials includes Russia\u2019s Far East and Siberia.<sup id=\"xref78\"><a href=\"#fn78\">78<\/a><\/sup> In the probable scenario according to which the main railway passage through Russian territory will go through Orenburg and Chelyabinsk, the Trans-Siberian Railway (TSR) and the Baikal\u2013Amur Mainline (BAM) will remain untouched, resulting in the bulk of transit fees going to Kazakhstan.<sup id=\"xref79\"><a href=\"#fn79\">79<\/a><\/sup> Besides, so far not a single Russian company has been involved in the development of the Alatau cluster, one of the main belts of growth, centred on Almaty.<\/p><p id=\"idm139942002458416\">Another important caveat is the criticism that there are no mechanisms to enable cooperation between the SREB and the EEU. For instance, it is clear that China and Russia need to work on liberalizing visas and customs in order for the integration process to work.<sup id=\"xref80\"><a href=\"#fn80\">80<\/a><\/sup> However, it is not clear how these steps will proceed. Ivan Zuenko argues that Russia and China should initiate platforms for discussion and working groups involving experts and officials in order to create the \u201cnecessary mechanisms and institutions acceptable to all parties involved.\u201d<sup id=\"xref81\"><a href=\"#fn81\">81<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139942002455728\">A major concern for Moscow is the question of whether the Belt and Road initiative will proceed in bilateral agreements with individual countries, or through multi-lateral agreements with regional organizations. Russia is keen on multi-lateral cooperation within EEU or SCO frameworks because it can exert more influence there compared to in bilateral negotiations.<sup id=\"xref82\"><a href=\"#fn82\">82<\/a><\/sup> Thus, one of the major challenges for Moscow is to get Beijing to cooperate at a multi-lateral level. In 2015, China started cooperating bilaterally with Georgia by cosponsoring the Silk Road Forum, the first SREB outside China which involved the Chinese government.<sup id=\"xref83\"><a href=\"#fn83\">83<\/a><\/sup> In December 2015, the first train from \u00dcr\u00fcmqi on \u201cSilk Road\u201d bypassing Russia, the \u201cNomad Express,\u201d arrived in Tbilisi, with its final destination being Istanbul.<\/p><p id=\"idm139941998428880\">Although railways play a key role in coordinating the SREB and the EEU, there are several problems. Sceptics argue that railways will never replace shipping, since a train has much less capacity to transfer containers. Thus, the only profitable products to transfer by land and train from China to Europe through Russia will be small objects with high value such as high technology.<sup id=\"xref84\"><a href=\"#fn84\">84<\/a><\/sup> Another problem is with the track gauge\u2014the gauge of railways financed by Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) meets European rather than Russian standards, meaning that containers have to be shifted by crane once on entering Kazakhstan, again when entering Poland, and once more in Western Europe. This implies the complete avoidance of the TSR and the BAM.<sup id=\"xref85\"><a href=\"#fn85\">85<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139941998425984\">Apparently, in the contemporary world, China is in many respects stronger than Russia. China\u2019s defence budget is the second largest in the world after that of the US, while Russia ranks fifth in the world. While technologically China is behind the West and Japan, it has managed to overtake Russia \u201cin many aspects of science and education.\u201d<sup id=\"xref86\"><a href=\"#fn86\">86<\/a><\/sup> Sceptics note that Russia will never have the upper hand in its relationship with China due to its economic weakness and the inefficiency of its companies.<sup id=\"xref87\"><a href=\"#fn87\">87<\/a><\/sup> As Timofei Bordachev notes, there is no word for \u201cbrother\u201d in the Chinese language, only two separate terms for \u201colder brother\u201d or \u201cyounger brother.\u201d Every relationship is thus based on a certain \u201colder\u2013younger\u201d hierarchy.<sup id=\"xref88\"><a href=\"#fn88\">88<\/a><\/sup> All these increase the risk of Russia becoming the \u201cjunior partner in a Beijing-led coalition.\u201d<sup id=\"xref89\"><a href=\"#fn89\">89<\/a><\/sup> The question is whether Russia will accept the role of a \u201cyounger brother,\u201d not only in SREB and EEU integration but also within wider Eurasian power dynamics. However, it seems that Russia has already accepted China\u2019s economic pre-eminence in Central Asia, a strategically important region for Moscow. In return, Moscow wants Beijing to respect its great power status and its special interest in the former Soviet Union. Officials in Beijing\u2019s corridors of power are very conscious of Russia\u2019s sensitivity to acting as the \u201cjunior partner\u201d in Sino-Russian interactions. As Marcin Kaczmarski brilliantly puts it, Beijing has so far succeeded in dispensing \u201cgreat-power respect to the Kremlin in regular doses.\u201d<sup id=\"xref90\"><a href=\"#fn90\">90<\/a><\/sup> The Kremlin hopes that Moscow and Beijing will create a synergy and dominate \u201cCentral Eurasia\u201d jointly, with Russia the main security provider and China the economic leader, responsible for pouring in resources. Following a successful integration between SREB and EEU, Moscow anticipates a reciprocal deal whereby Russia will receive investment in the form of access to $US40\u00a0billion from the Silk Road Construction Fund, while China can use Russia as a safe and reliable route to transfer its goods to Europe, given that with the EEU, a container has to pass only two customs posts between \u00dcr\u00fcmqi and Berlin.<sup id=\"xref91\"><a href=\"#fn91\">91<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139941998417888\">The issue of regional security is often ignored in discussions of China\u2019s initiative. The stability and security of the core of the SREB\u2014composed of China\u2019s Xinjiang, Central Asia, and Russia\u2019s own Tatarstan and Volga district\u2014is one of the main preconditions for the success of these regional integration projects and their integration. The major security threats include Islamism and the radicalization of Central Asian nations; the spillovers of instability from the troubled AfPak<sup id=\"xref92\"><a href=\"#fn92\">92<\/a><\/sup>; the ongoing Indo-Pakistani adversary; sectarian rivalries between Shiite Iran and the region\u2019s Sunni groups; organized crime and the drug trade; conflict over the region\u2019s natural resources and energy corridors; separatism in Russia and China; and the conflict between Russia and the West over Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea.<\/p><p id=\"idm139941998249248\">However, the existential threat to the stability of the wider region and to the realization of the SREB and its integration with the EEU is the rise of Islamism and Jihadism in China\u2019s Xinjiang, Central Asia, and Russia. Since 2001, the Central Asian region has not only gone through a period of accelerated Islamization of societies but also witnessed an explosion of radical groups. Furthermore, during the last 5\u201310 years, radical Islam has spread to Russia from the AfPak and Central Asian regions, including the formerly peaceful Muslim communities along the Volga.<sup id=\"xref93\"><a href=\"#fn93\">93<\/a><\/sup> Jund-al-Khilafah (Soldiers of the Caliphate), a Jihadi group active in Kazakhstan and Russia\u2019s Volga district, has been responsible for a number of terrorist attacks in Kazakhstan and has killed moderate imams in Tatarstan and the wider Volga district. Russia\u2019s Republic of Tatarstan has become one of the most volatile regions in the Federation. Since 2014, new less well-known Jihadi groups affiliated with Islamic State of Iraq and Syria have been active in the region. In 2014\u20132015, more than 300 Uyghur and thousands of other Jihadists from across the former Soviet Union joined the Islamic state, fighting in Iraq and Syria.<\/p><p id=\"idm139941998246656\">While there are numerous sources of instability in Central Asia, the major one being the above-mentioned AfPak, relations between the five Central Asian nations are far from stable. The Fergana Valley is one of the most complex examples of border delimitations, with the Uzbek-Kyrgyz and Uzbek-Tajik borders being disputed for two decades. As Lic\u00ednia Sim\u00e3o notes, border disputes become \u201cfar more complex when they overlap with \u2026 non-traditional security threats of [a] transnational nature.\u201d<sup id=\"xref94\"><a href=\"#fn94\">94<\/a><\/sup> The lucrative and profitable Afghan heroin trade has created many networks of transnational organized crime organizations, which \u201cundermine state institutions.\u201d<sup id=\"xref95\"><a href=\"#fn95\">95<\/a><\/sup> These are just a fraction of the security issues facing Beijing and Moscow on the Silk Road. Beijing\u2019s policy of containing instability and separatism maintains that delivering economic prosperity to the people involved is the most viable method of preventing them from \u201ccausing trouble.\u201d<sup id=\"xref96\"><a href=\"#fn96\">96<\/a><\/sup> This doctrine is one of the main motivations behind the whole initiative. However, a certain level of security is vital in order to implement the grand vision proposed by Xi Jinping, and it is not yet clear how the stability of the region will be guaranteed or by whom.<\/p><p id=\"idm139941998242240\">The Valdai forum report, mentioned earlier\u2014which promotes the idea of combining the SREB and the EEU\u2014argued that SREB member states could use SCO and The Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) \u201cmechanisms more actively\u201d in order to combat security issues such as the drug trade, Islamism, and the instability emanating from Afghanistan.<sup id=\"xref97\"><a href=\"#fn97\">97<\/a><\/sup> However, both the CSTO and the SCO have proved their impotence over the years when it comes to solving security issues and managing conflicts. This was evident during the 2010 unrest in Kyrgyzstan, when most SCO and CSTO member states refused to act to prevent the massacre which, as Sebastien Peyrouse and Marl\u00e8ne Laruelle argued, became \u201csymbolic\u201d of the failure of those regional organizations.<sup id=\"xref98\"><a href=\"#fn98\">98<\/a><\/sup> More importantly, the SCO has never demonstrated any willingness to replace US and The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) forces in the troubled AfPak region and become the main guarantor of stability. Therefore, Russia, China, and other member states have to strengthen political and security coordination within the SCO or the economic integration of Eurasia is doomed to fail.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139941997997968\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Concluding remarks<\/h3><p id=\"idm139941997997328\">The relationship between Russia and China is complex and multi-faceted and to define the nature of Sino-Russian rapprochement as a <i>Marriage of Convenience<\/i> or a <i>Strategic Partnership<\/i> would be both misleading and simplistic. The two nations cooperate on a plethora of strategically important issues because they share a lot of common interests. Moscow and Beijing have wisely solved issues where their interests converge and have done their utmost not to alienate each other through their differences and disagreement. Since Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin signed the initiative to integrate the SREB and the EEU on 8 May 2015, commentators close to the Kremlin have emphasized that Sino-Russian rapprochement has ascended to a new level of partnership. The Valdai forum report mentioned earlier highlights the need for the creation of a new \u201cCentral Eurasia\u201d region, based on the collaboration between the two projects.<sup id=\"xref99\"><a href=\"#fn99\">99<\/a><\/sup> Sergey Karaganov claims that the 8 May agreement is the foundation for the creation of \u201cGreater Eurasia\u201d to balance the US-led bloc which is seeking to limit China\u2019s influence in Eurasia through the initiatives such as TPP and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.<sup id=\"xref100\"><a href=\"#fn100\">100<\/a><\/sup> He believes that this could be the beginning of the return to a bipolar world order.<\/p><p id=\"idm139941997992960\">One should note that the partnership between Moscow and Beijing will continue in a positive trajectory independently of US actions because a good reciprocal relationship is in the interest of both nations. The two nations need each other\u2019s support over regional issues and in the global arena, including coordination in the UN Security Council. However, a Eurasian condominium between Moscow and Beijing against the US, or in Sergey Karaganov\u2019s words formation of the \u201cCentral Eurasia,\u201d should not be expected. First, Beijing has very strong established relations with Western countries, which China requires in order to ensure economic and technological development. Thus, the Communist Party of China has never demonstrated an interest in forming any kind of alliance with Russia against the West. Second, Russia\u2019s relationship with China is an important component of Vladimir Putin\u2019s great power narrative of a resurgent Russia and of Russia\u2019s competitive relationship with the US as its significant other. On the other hand, for Beijing, its improving relationship with Russia is just another success in its spectacular rise in the international arena, fruit of perspicacious diplomacy and profitable foreign policy. As Marl\u00e8ne Laruelle notes, the relationship between Moscow and Beijing is \u201cimbalanced, in terms of the importance that Russia gives it vs. the importance China gives it.\u201d<sup id=\"xref101\"><a href=\"#fn101\">101<\/a><\/sup> Therefore, there are no signs that the leadership in Beijing plans to turn its collaboration with Russia into a \u201cEurasian bloc or a two-power condominium in Eurasia.\u201d<sup id=\"xref102\"><a href=\"#fn102\">102<\/a><\/sup> China strives for productive and fruitful cooperation with all countries in the international arena and will never ally with any side at the expense of any other significant relationship. Indeed, as Alexander Lukin and Fedor Lukyanov have noted, Beijing will never undermine its relationship with the West for the sake of Russia\u2019s interest or vice versa.<sup id=\"xref103\"><a href=\"#fn103\">103<\/a><\/sup> Whether dealing with Moscow or Washington, China will always insist on its national interest with very tough terms.<sup id=\"xref104\"><a href=\"#fn104\">104<\/a><\/sup> This was evident during the lengthy negotiations over the 2014 gas deal, which was reportedly closed on Beijing\u2019s terms. Hence, a Moscow\u2013Beijing axis will never be formed, as neither country is prepared to give up its vast global interests.<\/p><p id=\"idm139941997986560\">The Belt and Road initiative has four major aims: improving regional infrastructure, increasing regional economic policy coordination, removing barriers to trade, and encouraging cultural ties between peoples.<sup id=\"xref105\"><a href=\"#fn105\">105<\/a><\/sup> The main limitation of the vision of spectacular significance is the lack of assurance for the region\u2019s countries that China is not simply seeking to establish and institutionalize its hegemony over Eurasia and turn the Silk Road into a large area of Chinese economic and neo-colonial dominance. Russians also fear that now when the international sanctions on Iran are lifted and Tehran is open for business, the Belt and Road can simply go across Eurasia, creating a massive trade and investment zone for China and omitting Russia. Indeed, Russia\u2019s uncertain function in future will be to accommodate one of the routes for the transfer of goods from Southeast Asia to Europe. This lack of clarity is one of the main limitations of the entire Belt and Road.<\/p><p id=\"idm139941997984208\">Furthermore, as demonstrated above, there are numerous contradictions between the two Eurasian projects, and if they are ignored, integration of the SREB and the EEU is doomed to failure. In order to make integration work, both nations need to explore a number of questions. These include developing mechanisms of cooperation between Russia, China, and the other nations involved and solving practical issues such as with rail gauges and corruption along the routes. If these are not addressed at the initial stage, it might take years before any progress is achieved.<\/p><p id=\"idm139941998022176\">An important but often ignored issue is the great power insecurities of Russia\u2019s political elite. So far, Chinese diplomats and politicians have done a brilliant job in ensuring that Moscow feels that it its interests are respected. However, China\u2019s endeavour to interact in a bilateral format with regional countries such as Georgia and Ukraine could cause tensions between Moscow and Beijing.<\/p><p id=\"idm139941998021312\">Finally, the existential threat to the success of the SREB and its integration with the EEU is the security threats in the core area outlined earlier in this study, involving instability and drugs emanating from Afghanistan and Islamism in the region. The roots of growing Islamic fundamentalism lie in the foreign policies of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and for it to be eradicated, these countries have to change their entire foreign policy doctrine. One can only hope that the prosperity and stability delivered by the Belt and Road will change the strategic thinking of these nation\u2019s elites and eradicate the long-lasting hostilities between the region\u2019s various groups and nations.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div id=\"article-back\" class=\"back\"><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139941998017568\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Competing interests<\/h3><p id=\"idm139941998016464\">Kaneshko Sangar declares that he has no conflict of interest.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"back-section\"><a id=\"idm139941998019520\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Acknowledgments<\/h3><p id=\"idm139941998018720\">I would like to express my special appreciation and thanks to Dr Vsevolod Samokhvalov and Professor Siddharth Saxena for organizing the workshop where earlier version of this article was presented.

Uncertainty of territorial arrangements persists; however, the era of commonality and interdependence may be at its end due to the establishment of a border as a means of spatial control. Border drawing reflects the divergent development trajectories of the new states, seeking to break out of an interdependence pattern. Borderlands\u2019 interactions become more conflictual. Generation change and a loss of common language work to widen the inter-communal gap. Ethnicity and identity factors grew in significance as association with the nation-states increased, and a border expresses a symbol of nationhood in this paradigm. Crucially, a border justifies a security regime, reinforced by international assistance policies, to project power over the territory. Actions of security structures cause grievances but also signify a protective arm of the state, a role that the border communities appreciate, themselves acting as a collective border guard and projecting their fears of encroachment onto the borders. The expansion of the Eurasian Economic Union became a new factor that could have served to alleviate the pressure to divide territory and assets, but this could work only if two countries joined it at the same period. With this option unavailable, a territorial impasse has been reached.<\/p><\/div>\n",

In 25 years of\n            independence, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan succeeded in delimiting 519\u00a0km out of 978\u00a0km of their mutual border,\n            while the remaining 459 km in densely populated lowlands are subject to mutual claims and include 58\n            separately contested sections. Throughout these times, the capitals of both countries have been reluctant to\n            act decisively and preferred a <i>status quo<\/i> of unsettled borders, being keen to preserve positive\n            interstate relations and feeling unable to move against the wishes of their border communities.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980582160\">Inherited Soviet boundaries were not drawn as impermeable borders of independent\n            states but were in an ongoing process of adjustment to population movement and economic developments. First,\n            the ethnic composition was changing throughout the Soviet history, as people from the mountains had been\n            resettled onto plains populated by other ethnic groups. Second, the borders were redrawn to suit the\n            evolving agricultural practices, which witnessed increases in both irrigation and the amount of cultivated\n            area.<sup id=\"xref1\"><a href=\"#fn1\">1<\/a><\/sup> Third, parity commissions from the Tajik and Kyrgyz Union\n            Republics met every decade to adjust borders to the land use of the moment,<sup id=\"xref2\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn2\">2<\/a><\/sup> but solutions that addressed one problem tended to create another, which\n            triggered new rounds of revisions later.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980618832\">This legacy presently gives grounds to conflicting territorial claims: Tajikistan\n            insists on restoration of \u201chistorical justice\u201d as reflected in the 1924\u20131927 maps, which show that many\n            contested lands used to belong to the Tajik Union Republic, while Kyrgyzstan stands by the 1958 maps drawn\n            after several waves of resettlement. Discourse often attributes the problem to the \u201cdivide-and-rule\u201d\n            intentions of Soviet planners who left the ill-defined and ill-suited borders as a deliberate legacy without\n            examining the arguments behind continuous border revisions of the Soviet era.<sup id=\"xref3\"><a href=\"#fn3\">3<\/a><\/sup>\n            Presently, this is a genuine puzzle with no obvious territorial solution fair to all parties, which has led\n            to multiple security incidents and has narrowly avoided an armed conflict.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980627456\">The reasoning that explains the insecurity in borderlands popular among donors and\n            aid agencies is that the conflicts arise from threatened livelihood and resource sharing. Indeed, tensions\n            often start from a hampered access to life necessities, such as water, grazing land or markets. This article\n            acknowledges the validity of this perspective but argues that the underlying conflict driver is the very\n            establishment of the border and the culture of projection-of-force that came with it. A border (1) expresses\n            a symbol of new nationhood and contributes to ethnic consolidation, (2) justifies a security regime to mark\n            control over the territory, and (3) reflects divergent development trajectories of the new states that plan\n            their own futures. The Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) could have served as an overarching umbrella to\n            downplay the significance of borders as security regimes and alleviate the pressure to divide territory and\n            assets, but this option could work only if the two countries joined at the same time or within a short\n            distance from each other.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980590800\">The article addresses the question why it proved so difficult to establish the border\n            in this case when other post-Soviet states with similar legacies mostly resolved their territorial issues. I\n            attribute these reasons to an increasingly strong affiliation between territory and identity, population\n            density with few natural geographical features to act as separation landmarks and reluctance of the states\n            to impose solutions against the will of their border communities. I argue that the conditions remain fragile\n            and prone to sudden deterioration. While the talk of border delimitation continues, the absence of a\n            democratically negotiated or an authoritarianly imposed solution signifies that the very task is impossible\n            and is best abandoned. More creative solutions based on shared sovereignty and recognition of\n            interdependence must be found to achieve sustainable security.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980636800\">The article bases its argument on Newman\u2019s perspective that rather than viewing\n            international boundaries as static markers of the formal extent of state control, they should be conceived\n            as part of dynamic processes that socially construct differences between groups of people.<sup id=\"xref4\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn4\">4<\/a><\/sup> He stresses the importance of territory and its physical delimiters in the\n            formation of ethnic and national identities and applies the term <i>re-territorialisation<\/i> to describe\n            the relationship between national identity and territorial reconfiguration. Formation of national identities\n            is strongly tied up with both the changing spatial configurations of political power and the idea of a\n            \u201chomeland.\u201d Ethnic\/national groups aspire to strengthen the link between territory and identity when they\n            create new boundaries of separation, using symbols of statehood.<sup id=\"xref5\"><a href=\"#fn5\">5<\/a><\/sup>\n            This is the slow-moving process underway in the Ferghana Valley that I analyse.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980665792\">I invoke Kuzmits\u2019s concept of \u201cunruly borderlands,\u201d where the state dominates or\n            absorbs the local elite, but neither the state nor the security apparatus gains a commanding position over\n            the population, making the borderland difficult to control.<sup id=\"xref6\"><a href=\"#fn6\">6<\/a><\/sup> The\n            dialectics of the separation processes at the grassroot and the elite levels is quite complex, and local\n            societies are important actors in their own right, showing the capitals\u2019 limitation in terms of their\n            actions.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980583664\">Security perceptions are important for the analysis of border problems. Madeleine\n            Reeves explains that a border expresses a desire for stability in unstable contexts: \u201cbeing bordered often\n            matters intensely to those living at the border and it most matters precisely in those contexts where the\n            institutional and geographical locus of the \u2018state\u2019 is in flux.\u201d She situates \u201cterritory\u201d within the realm\n            of feeling: fear and suffering, perhaps, but also the object of hope and the site of practical claims\n            making.<sup id=\"xref7\"><a href=\"#fn7\">7<\/a><\/sup> A border is experienced as a place of limits and gaps<sup\n                    id=\"xref8\"><a href=\"#fn8\">8<\/a><\/sup> where we can observe \u201cthe improvisatory work of everyday state\n            formation,\u201d<sup id=\"xref9\"><a href=\"#fn9\">9<\/a><\/sup> which has to \u201cfeel\u201d its way through the bordering\n            project.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980597584\">I further argue that the world of cross-border interactions based on multiple\n            spatiality, interconnected localised identities, delicate patterns of interdependence, competition and\n            commonality that Reeves describes<sup id=\"xref10\"><a href=\"#fn10\">10<\/a><\/sup> is at its end. Newly\n            established sovereignty and fascination with its attributes present formidable commodities to be reckoned\n            with. As Reeves writes, \u201cour imagination of borders is fundamentally constituted by the state\u2019s own\n            categories and cartography.\u201d<sup id=\"xref11\"><a href=\"#fn11\">11<\/a><\/sup> The ability to erect borders,\n            deploy guards, fly the flag and claim a sovereign, undivided territory is greatly valued: \u201cwhere there\n            exists a notion of a state, the notion of border is also present, if this is a sovereign state.\u201d<sup\n                    id=\"xref12\"><a href=\"#fn12\">12<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980567312\">As the \u201cproject of territorial sovereignty\u201d gains momentum, harsh realities of\n            separation kick in. The question is what is replacing the old world of commonality and interdependence. How\n            much do principles of territoriality and sovereignty matter for human experience at the borderlands? To what\n            extent does addressing livelihood issues necessitate a guarded frontier? Would the future bear more\n            segregation or interdependency? The answers are shaped by the evolving relationship between ethnicity,\n            nation and state, wherein three factors are important: ethnic consolidation accelerated by generation\n            change, security deployment and economic interdependency. The article analyses their interplay and how they\n            affect the policies at the inter-state level in order to be able to make a projection into the future. I\n            call for what Martinez terms \u201cintegrated borderland,\u201d which includes the removal of all barriers and\n            obstacles to cross-border communication, exchange and movement of people, goods, services and capital, along\n            with the development of a common cultural and political cross-border identity.<sup id=\"xref13\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn13\">13<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980579248\">My field research consisted of key informant interviews, focus groups and field\n            observations. It was conducted in 2013, 2014 and 2016 in Soghd oblast of Tajikistan and border areas of\n            Kyrgyzstan (Batken, Osh and Jalalabad oblasts). It builds upon prior research in 2003\u20132005 in the same\n            territories, which allows tracing the dynamics of change. The article uses data from the M-Vector attitude\n            survey conducted for the United Nations Development Programme in seven cross-border clusters of Kyrgyzstan\n            in 2015.<sup id=\"xref14\"><a href=\"#fn14\">14<\/a><\/sup><\/p><\/div>\n    <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm140196980580928\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a>\n\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Ethnicity and identity formation<\/h3>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980581760\">In a way, problems on the Tajik\u2013Kyrgyz border are not new. These lands were subject\n            to conflicts in 1936, 1938, 1969, 1975 and 1989. Disagreements over land led to open confrontations, such as\n            that between Ak-Sai and Voruh in 1975 and 1989 and that between Uch-Dobo and Khoja-i Alo in 1989, when a\n            dispute over water escalated into violence with the use of stones, farm tools and firearms. Violence was\n            halted by deployment of the Soviet Special Forces and army regiments. Several Soviet attempts to resolve the\n            border issues by setting up conciliation commissions consisting of representatives of the two Republics\n            failed to reach an agreement. In the aftermath of the 1989 violence, a parity commission sought to reconcile\n            the sides, but it struggled with border delineation, as the parties brought documents, maps and eye witness\n            accounts as proofs for their conflicting claims. Still, most of the time, the communities lived with their\n            resource-sharing disputes in peace and developed mechanisms of adaptation to their seasonal dynamics.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980625184\">What has changed is that the factor of ethnicity has grown in significance since\n            early independence, as association of the populations with the nation-states increased, although scholarship\n            on the region often tends to downplay the significance of ethnic differences amid other processes and\n            characteristics.<sup id=\"xref15\"><a href=\"#fn15\">15<\/a><\/sup> Still, Reeves observes that \u201cin this\n            particular part of the Ferghana Valley basin, ethnicity has come to be so very salient as an everyday\n            \u2018practical category\u2019.\u201d<sup id=\"xref16\"><a href=\"#fn16\">16<\/a><\/sup> Whereas in the past people used to\n            associate mainly with their particular localities and saw their neighbours as associates in that locality,\n            in the 2003\u20132013 decade, ethnic differences became more pronounced. Communities came to more readily\n            affiliate with their ethnic groups and tend to stereotype the opponent in increasingly ethnic terms.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980609056\">National-patriotic values have grown stronger\u2014and a pasture dispute gets interpreted\n            as a matter of national survival. Land is not a mere agricultural resource: it has a symbolic meaning for\n            nationhood, still quite new. As explained by a local analyst, \u201ceach side has to drink enough of its\n            sovereignty before it can compromise.\u201d<sup id=\"xref17\"><a href=\"#fn17\">17<\/a><\/sup> State action works to\n            emphasise the dominant ethnicity by claiming a cultural space: Tajikistan renames geographical locations to\n            erase Turkic designations and expand a Tajik linguistic presence. As a result, in 2016, Qairaqqum, a town in\n            the Kyrgyz border vicinity, became Guliston and the Soviet-era artificial water reservoir of the same name\n            was renamed the \u201cTajik Sea.\u201d<sup id=\"xref18\"><a href=\"#fn18\">18<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980620880\">Fear became a catalyst in the border communities\u2019 identity formation. Following\n            Reeves\u2019s<sup id=\"xref19\"><a href=\"#fn19\">19<\/a><\/sup> call for a dynamic approach to place, I identify\n            borders as places where people project their fears onto each other. The communities and local authorities\n            largely do not expect positive intentions from their neighbours but suspect them of ambitions to encroach\n            onto their territory, deprive them of resources and assets, and project instability across the borders. They\n            fear that they will be encircled, trapped into uncomfortable arrangements and harassed by security\n            structures.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980624272\">Demography adds to fears of the Kyrgyz communities and increases their sense of\n            vulnerability. Three municipalities of Isfara district of Tajikistan \u2014 Voruh, Chorkuh and Surkh \u2014 are\n            populated by about 100,000 inhabitants. They are faced by smaller Kyrgyz municipalities of Ak-Sai, Ak Tatyr\n            and Samarkandek in Batken district with barely 20,000 inhabitants,<sup id=\"xref20\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn20\">20<\/a><\/sup> who perceive that demographic pressure prompts territorial expansion of\n            their neighbours who need more and more land to survive. The future appears unpromising \u2014 in this paradigm,\n            hardship and isolation would foster depopulation leaving fewer Kyrgyz to oppose the encroaching Tajiks.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980632848\">Compared to the early 2000s, ethnic differences have acquired a more negative\n            connotation, and local actors increasingly perceive everyday conflicts in ethnic terms. Problems that\n            originally start as mundane village disputes assume a character of ethnic polarisation and end in arguments\n            such as \u201cthis is our historical land\u201d and \u201cyou have no right to be here.\u201d Such calls carry an emotional\n            resonance, evoke feelings of patriotism and enable mobilisation of a larger constituency for defence of the\n            \u201cterritorial integrity\u201d even over petty disputes.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980633824\">Inter-ethnic relations are worse in areas with a prior history of conflicts. The\n            M-Vector 2015 survey returned data that the population of the Ak-Tatyr\/Uch\u2013Dobo\/Tash\u2013Tumshuk cluster\n            (predominantly ethnic Kyrgyz) demonstrated the most negative attitude towards Tajiks as a neighbouring\n            ethnic group (score: 1.3% out of a maximum of 6.0) because these villages had numerous problems with the\n            bordering Khoja-i Alo, a village in Chorkuh municipality of Tajikistan. By contrast, the Arca\u2013Kostakoz\n            cluster, wherein conflicts were rare and non-violent, returned a score of 4.8. Measured on the Bogardus\n            Social Distance Scale,<sup id=\"xref21\"><a href=\"#fn21\">21<\/a><\/sup> the distance was the biggest between the\n            majority Kyrgyz and Tajik groups as compared to the ethnic minorities (Uzbeks and Russians) living in the\n            same area.<sup id=\"xref22\"><a href=\"#fn22\">22<\/a><\/sup> Overall, the level of trust by the Kyrgyz group in\n            the seven clusters towards their Tajik neighbours scored 3.4 out of a maximum of 6.0.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980642400\">Dangers stemming from others do not have to be objectively verifiable, as \u201cdanger is\n            an effect of interpretation.\u201d<sup id=\"xref23\"><a href=\"#fn23\">23<\/a><\/sup> In this paradigm, border posts\n            are believed to \u201cmove\u201d every year by 50\u00a0cm and, in 20 years, gain 10\u00a0m of territory. Even cleaning of\n            waterways is contentious, suspected of being a part of a step-by-step territorial acquisition plot. Kyrgyz\n            respondents in Ak-Sai municipality were convinced that the boundary moves closer into their land. As a\n            result, Kyrgyz border guards obstruct Tajik farmers from cleaning trans-boundary waterways to prevent their\n            \u201csubversive activity.\u201d<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980646816\">This is not to say that ethnicity is the sole or even major preoccupation for those\n            living in borderlands at the time of peace. It moves to the forefront at crisis times, when a collective\n            identity is threatened, as during the June 2010 events in Kyrgyzstan, and mobilisation along ethnic lines\n            occurs.<sup id=\"xref24\"><a href=\"#fn24\">24<\/a><\/sup> In such circumstances, populations act as a collective\n            border guard, battling insecurity. Perception of a collective threat fosters appreciation of their role in\n            the line of defence against outsiders and strengthens nationhood associations. Local authorities, in their\n            turn, encourage creation of a human buffer along the borderline, so that their citizens occupy land and\n            housing, and prevent emergence of a vacuum into which the other can move in. Construction of restaurants,\n            hotels and petrol stations along the Khujand\u2013Konibodom Highway separating the two states is interpreted as\n            occupying a space that can be claimed later.<sup id=\"xref25\"><a href=\"#fn25\">25<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980552288\">Trend towards ethnic purity in settlement practice reflects a sense of fear. Kyrgyz\n            and Tajik families who are in minority in each other\u2019s villages<sup id=\"xref26\"><a href=\"#fn26\">26<\/a><\/sup>\n            seek to move to their ethnic majority municipalities to avoid becoming hostages in future crises. The\n            authorities hope that people would find ways of swapping land and houses and that they would not be\n            confronted with pressure to protect their ethnic kin on the other side if they are threatened.<sup\n                    id=\"xref27\"><a href=\"#fn27\">27<\/a><\/sup> Ethnic solidarity transpires across borders. In December\n            2011, a fight broke out in Andarak (Kyrgyzstan) between ethnic Kyrgyz and Tajik villagers. Tajik young men\n            from Jabbor Rasulov district (Tajikistan) quickly mobilised to drive to Andarak on receiving calls from\n            their Andarak Tajik friends that \u201c<i>nashikh b\u2019yut\u201d<\/i> \u201cour guys are beaten.\u201d<sup id=\"xref28\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn28\">28<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980603152\">Ethnic affiliations affect the perspectives on how the border regime is regarded, as\n            the importance of boundaries hinges on the question of whether the other beyond the boundary is perceived as\n            threatening or supportive.<sup id=\"xref29\"><a href=\"#fn29\">29<\/a><\/sup> Communities in the border areas of\n            Kyrgyzstan where the population is majority Uzbek on both sides seek an open regime.<sup id=\"xref30\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn30\">30<\/a><\/sup> However, when different ethnic groups face each other across the border,\n            the quest for strengthening defences grows, so that \u201cwe do not get trouble from them.\u201d Thus, the\n            significance of borders scales up and down depending on the perceptions of insecurity, while borders give an\n            orientation that encourages a feeling of security.<sup id=\"xref31\"><a href=\"#fn31\">31<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980617296\">The generation change and subsequent loss of common language work to increase the\n            social gap between border communities. They have invested little themselves into preservation of\n            inter-ethnic relations with their neighbours, viewing this as a domain for international tolerance-promotion\n            projects. Social distances in the meantime have increased, as those born after 1985 presently enter\n            adulthood, while the overarching Soviet identity and associated internationalist values move further away.\n            There are fewer integrating mechanisms such as shared education, employment and Soviet army service.\n            Deterioration of education facilities and standards, lack of structured employment, high rate of school\n            dropout and limited social opportunities create conditions for disorderly behaviour. As young men and\n            adolescent boys are the most frequent victims of cross-ethnic violence\u2014both sides report beatings on the\n            other\u2019s territory\u2014they are also the likely perpetrators. They are the first to be harassed by the police and\n            border guards, to become frustrated, turn to aggression and take it on the other group.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980637104\">Elders of the Soviet generation have limited control over young men, as the role\n            models of young men have changed and they tend to listen to the authority figures closer in age, such as\n            \u201csportsmen,\u201d businessmen and crime bosses. Social control is often exercised by young people over the older\n            generation and they are keener on standing for territorial integrity than their Sovietised fathers and\n            grandfathers: \u2018<i>I will not give up a molecule of my land\u2019<\/i>.<sup id=\"xref32\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn32\">32<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980635264\">Generation change affects traditional peacemaking, which is not popular anyhow\n            despite the authorities pushing in that direction. As the Tajiks are more dependent on the other side, they\n            typically initiate a local peace after incidents, sending delegations of mullahs, elders and municipal\n            authorities. Such was the case at a reconciliation event in 2013 between Voruh and Samarkandek when the\n            Tajik side was represented by <i>aksakals<\/i> (elders). The Kyrgyz side mostly brought young men, who did\n            not possess the same culture of restraint, became emotional and scared their Tajik interlocutors. Local\n            peace was not achieved.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980641392\">Aggressive promotion of language policies and public pressure to speak state\n            languages contribute to segregation. Young community members have few incentives to learn each other\u2019s\n            languages, whereas proficiency in Russian has declined. In the M-Vector survey, 32% respondents said that\n            they \u201cunderstand a little\u201d and 12.6% responded that they \u201cdo not know a single word\u201d of Russian. At the same\n            time, visual means have increased access to information via the Internet and have enhanced transparency and\n            distribution speed, but also contributed to proliferation of false rumours. Video technology allows shooting\n            fights and attacks to publicise evidence confirming one\u2019s storyline and quickly make it accessible via\n            mobile technology. Social sites, such as Facebook and <i>Odnoklassniki<\/i>, are actively used for uncensored\n            coverage, prompting the Tajik government to ban Facebook altogether. Still, labour migrants abroad publicise\n            video material of incidents that they receive from their home villages on social networking sites.<\/p><\/div>\n    <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm140196980648336\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a>\n\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Livelihoods in coexistence and conflict<\/h3>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980656512\"><i>We want to live in peace. But let\u2019s not mix up the problem of drinking and\n            irrigation water with high politics<\/i><sup id=\"xref33\"><a href=\"#fn33\">33<\/a><\/sup> is how a local resident\n            summed up the prevailing sentiment. In reality, economic considerations drive in different directions, while\n            \u201czero-sum\u201d logic dominates the public mind, as illustrated by farming land disputes. Local conflicts over\n            land broke up between Kok-Tash and Chorkuh in 2000, between the Langar community (Chorkuh) and Kok-Tash\n            (Samarkandek) villagers in 2000 and 2001 over the Kara land plot. In 2003, an agreement was reached, which\n            committed the parties to abstain from farming contested territories. This slowed down land cultivation, and\n            as of 2016, the Kara plot still lay idle. The sides could have cultivated contested land by splitting it\n            half-and-half temporarily, but prefer not to, as each believes that the border delimitation would be in\n            their exclusive favour.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980577904\">Inter-ethnic tensions typically start with some livelihood triggers that ignite them.\n            Resource-sharing disputes revolve around two main issues\u2014water and pastures (the other problems are farmland\n            and woodcutting). Water can have multiple meanings, being, as Bichsel calls it, \u201ca mobile, flexible and\n            fugitive natural resource with an inherent uncertainty about its quantity and location.\u201d<sup id=\"xref34\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn34\">34<\/a><\/sup> Water conflicts can be about absolute shortages due to the economic\n            decline, population growth and climate change. The Shurab\u2013Voruh drinking water pipeline is a festering\n            issue: although paper crack repairs are occasionally conducted, their scale is insufficient to resolve the\n            problem. Bichsel identifies upstream\u2014downstream geographic position as determining power relations in\n            irrigation conflicts. They can be about resource allocation: more typical are the situations when the Kyrgyz\n            live upstream and have better access to water while downstream Tajiks do not receive enough.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980619632\">Conflicts can be about attempts to bring irrigation to the new territories. The\n            recurring water conflict in Ak-Sai\u2013Voruh revolves over the Tajik farmers\u2019 efforts to expand cultivation area\n            and attempts to deny irrigation water by the Kyrgyz community to prevent this expansion. Khoja-i Alo\n            (Chorkuh) and neighbouring Kyrgyz villages use waters of the Matchoi Canal, and both sides blame each other\n            for taking more than their fair share. Tajiks are convinced that the land around the canal belongs to them,\n            while the Kyrgyz dispute this. Moreover, such conflicts are often exacerbated by historical memories of\n            belonging of territories lost as a consequence of Soviet boundary redrawals.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980931504\">Ageing infrastructure and poor maintenance add fuel to tensions, but technical\n            solutions to water problems run against territorial claims and the ability of each side to use water as\n            leverage during unrest. Two new water pipelines in Voruh and one in Chorkuh, which go through contested\n            land, could not be built because Kyrgyz municipalities did not allow sections to traverse their\n            territory.<sup id=\"xref35\"><a href=\"#fn35\">35<\/a><\/sup> Voices are heard that no new installations based on\n            interdependency should be constructed before delimitation takes place.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980574672\">Water and land are intertwined in the conflict microcosm as the Kyrgyz view the\n            problem through the prism of Tajik expansion. Pastures are mostly located in Kyrgyzstan, and often Kyrgyz\n            work as shepherds for Tajik livestock. When pastures were rented out to the Tajik side in the past, the\n            leasers installed water supply and converted pastures to farmland. Hence the desire to restrict access to\n            pastures nowadays. The Tajik view is that irrigated land cultivation is a better use of land than extensive\n            cattle breeding and that they contribute more to the development of the region.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980573792\">Tajik citizens are charged a higher fee for pasture access and regard the demand to\n            pay for the \u201cGod\u2019s gift\u201d as grossly unfair. In the past, kolkhozes received free allocations of grazing\n            lands. Presently, each municipality has a right to set own prices for foreign nationals; this results in\n            higher mark-ups than domestic user charge. Tajik communities regard this as rampant rent-seeking as pastures\n            would lie idle if they were not used. They argue in response that \u201cwe do not charge the Kyrgyz different\n            prices for a <i>marshrutka<\/i> ride\u2014why should we pay more for pastures?\u201d<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980731808\">Livestock theft is a chronic irritant. According to the Kyrgyz side, herding cattle\n            through Voruh was problematic because 5%\u201310% of livestock was lost to thieves.<sup id=\"xref36\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn36\">36<\/a><\/sup> In 2013, the situation got so bad that the Kyrgyz shepherds had to be\n            accompanied by armed police to traverse through the area. Tajik authorities denied the claims and noted that\n            livestock destroys the crops they cultivate and that 150 of their own livestock also disappeared.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980606800\">Natural resources are vital as symbolic stakes and a century-long way of life, which\n            includes keeping farm animals and cultivating land. However, the question is how much agriculture really\n            matters for economic survival, and if threatened, does it present a big enough danger to foster violent\n            conflict? Arable land is in short supply: there are 12,000\u00a0ha of irrigated land in Tajikistan\u2019s Isfara\n            district (4.5\u00a0ha for ploughing and 7.5\u00a0ha for horticulture) for 230,000 inhabitants. However, agriculture is\n            not the sole revenue. The M-Vector survey found that only 24.7% respondents identified agriculture as their\n            main income source. These data question the causal link between scarcity and violence.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980563296\">Moreover, the efficiency of agriculture is uncertain. In Voruh, the disputed lands\n            are located in the foothills, to which water would have to be pumped up by a motor. This requires energy\n            supplies for the pumps to work and makes it expensive. Even in the prosperous Bobojon Gaffurov district, 80%\n            of land is irrigated by pumps, for which an amount of 6.5 million TJS (Tajikistan Somoni) per year is\n            required to cover electricity bills. The district head admitted that he doubted how efficient land\n            cultivation based on pumping water uphill is, if the full cost of electricity, pump maintenance and staff\n            salaries were added.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980650816\">Uncertainty over borders halts development; isolation holds the region behind and\n            dictates the need for better communications to break out of it, adding an infrastructural dimension to the\n            quest for defined borders. The view from Kyrgyzstan is that with unsettled borders, there is no assurance of\n            settled and stable relations.<sup id=\"xref37\"><a href=\"#fn37\">37<\/a><\/sup> A moratorium on construction on\n            contested lands is constantly subjected to pressures on the ground.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980562896\">Many of the existing roads traverse the other\u2019s territory, creating a sense of\n            dependency and vulnerability. Local observers noted that the roads \u201cbecame the reason for all our\n            conflicts.\u201d<sup id=\"xref38\"><a href=\"#fn38\">38<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980613456\">Communities feel empowered when they have the leverage of a road blockage in case\n            tensions flare up. For example, in 2008, Tajikistan leased a section of the Batken\u2013Leilek Highway to\n            Kyrgyzstan under the agreement on temporary mutual land exchange of 18 May 2005. The Tajik community was\n            dissatisfied as it lost a potential leverage to block the road. Dushanbe, they maintained, failed to take\n            their interests into account. They were unhappy with the government for agreeing to a Kyrgyz road project\n            via Samarkandek, which their neighbours sought to build to avoid traversing through Uzbekistan.<sup\n                    id=\"xref39\"><a href=\"#fn39\">39<\/a><\/sup> Road closure proved an effective weapon. In 2013, Kyrgyz\n            communities blocked a road, demanding construction of an Ak-Sai\u2013Kok Tash bypass to avoid driving through the\n            junction where village roads intersect and \u201cinterstate\u201d traffic accidents are frequent. Instead of\n            installing traffic lights, deputy premier Tokon Mamytov ordered the construction to appease his citizens. In\n            response, the Tajik neighbours staged protests to obstruct it. Troops were brought in to secure the project\n            and it went ahead.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980595744\">Communities essentially regard interdependency as negative and temporary compromise,\n            as not sustainable in future and a problem that should be solved. The prevailing view is that \u201cif only we\n            could be self-sufficient, this would improve our lives greatly.\u201d This aspiration is hard to put into\n            practice under the conditions of chessboard settlement patterns and the necessity to share resources.\n            However, infrastructure is being built to break out the interdependence pattern\u2014even if this is the least\n            cost-effective solution. Developments that improve self-sufficiency are viewed as success, such as\n            construction of a separate school in Jabbor Rasulov district (Tajikistan) which has an enclave in Leilek. As\n            a result, Tajik children can attend school without crossing into Kyrgyzstan\u2019s territory. The head of Jabbor\n            Rasulov district commented that \u201cseparate roads are a requirement of any independent country.\u201d<sup\n                    id=\"xref40\"><a href=\"#fn40\">40<\/a><\/sup> Erection of independent water installations is under way:\n            in Ak-Sai, the Kyrgyz side built a water pumping station to separate the supply from the Tajik neighbours.\n        <\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980595280\">Another driver is the so-called \u201ccreeping migration,\u201d especially in the Arca\u2013Kostakuz\n            (renamed Khistavrez) area, which the Kyrgyz interpret as a Tajik Occupy movement. The term designates\n            settlement onto scarcely populated lands by citizens of the neighbouring state. Reeves describes both a fear\n            of cultural transformation and of \u201cmoving the border\u201d by a hard-to-observe creep movement that eventually\n            turns into \u201ca threat to the very integrity of the state.\u201d<sup id=\"xref41\"><a href=\"#fn41\">41<\/a><\/sup> In\n            the past, Kyrgyz individuals sold or leased their land to the Tajiks when they were not interested in it or\n            moved away. The sales were semi-legal because Kyrgyzstan\u2019s law prohibits sales of land and housing in the\n            border areas to foreign nationals.<sup id=\"xref42\"><a href=\"#fn42\">42<\/a><\/sup> However, the purchasers hold\n            what they believe are valid contracts, as they paid a market price for them. They appeal to the district\n            authorities to either keep their houses on the other side or receive compensation.<sup id=\"xref43\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn43\">43<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980588576\">Here we observe how territorial separation creates a mechanism of control through\n            which identity is imposed upon constituents.<sup id=\"xref44\"><a href=\"#fn44\">44<\/a><\/sup> After a series of\n            incidents when in February 2016 border guards placed Kyrgyzstan\u2019s flags over the houses of Tajik families in\n            Kulunda area in Leilek district and deported several of them,<sup id=\"xref45\"><a href=\"#fn45\">45<\/a><\/sup>\n            Tajik settlers were offered an option to take up Kyrgyzstan\u2019s citizenship and stay in their homes. For that,\n            they had to bring a documented proof of renouncing their Tajikistani citizenship, which the local\n            authorities were under covert orders not to issue. This is perhaps so because the land is contested:\n            although the 1958 map indicates its belonging to Kyrgyzstan, earlier territorial designation shows\n            otherwise. Thus, \u201cmy state is where my people are\u201d is a notion that elevated a squatter dispute to a matter\n            of territorial integrity.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980565264\">At the same time, many connectors persist. Grey economy works towards preservation of\n            the <i>status quo<\/i>. Opportunities in informal trade\u2014reinforced by Kyrgyzstan\u2019s accession to the\n            EEU\u2014necessitate porous borders and a degree of trust between the sides. Traders are often the first people\n            to facilitate peace after incidents. Illegal trade opportunities allow avoiding customs duties and license\n            fees. The scale of informal trade and illegal crossings shows a high degree of cooperation, while business\n            and drug trafficking are said to cut across ethnic lines. It is believed that about one million dollars a\n            year goes via Surkh alone. The main commodities are scrap metal from Central Asia going to China,\n            fertiliser, mercury, re-export of cheap petrol supplied by Moscow to Kyrgyzstan and dried fruit from\n            Tajikistan <i>en route<\/i> to Russia. Cross-border trade facilitation is a fashionable topic in\n            international development but experiences a low demand in knowledge of the legal side of things.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980658928\">Shepherds are also conduits of deals. As Chorkuh has no pastures of its own, Tajik\n            farmers have to use Karavshin and Kashambish pastures in Kyrgyzstan. They have a choice to either pay the\n            full pasture fee to a Kyrgyz municipality or to make informal deals with shepherds so they pretend that they\n            herd Kyrgyz livestock. Shepherds are to resolve issues with border guards if they are detained with a wrong\n            number of sheep on the way back. When they are unable to fulfill their promises, Tajik owners have few means\n            of redress.<\/p><\/div>\n    <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm140196980658096\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a>\n\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Securitisation as a security threat<\/h3>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980665520\">Security dynamics deteriorated gradually, with little attention paid to it until a\n            sudden surge in 2013. From January 2010 to February 2013, 62 security incidents took place at the\n            Kyrgyzstan\u2013Tajikistan border.<sup id=\"xref46\"><a href=\"#fn46\">46<\/a><\/sup> According to Kyrgyzstan\u2019s Border\n            Service, in 2012, 15 incidents took place on the Batken\/Isfara border segment, but in the first 6\u00a0months of\n            2013, there were 50 incidents.<sup id=\"xref47\"><a href=\"#fn47\">47<\/a><\/sup> In 10\u00a0months of 2014, 40 border\n            incidents took place in Kyrgyzstan overall, 32 of them on the Tajik border (year-to-year two-fold increase)\n            and only 5 with Uzbekistan.<sup id=\"xref48\"><a href=\"#fn48\">48<\/a><\/sup> The scale and intensity of the\n            2013\u20132014 incidents were notably different, as well as the speed with which popular mobilisation occurred.\n            New claims over oil deposits, bridges and roads, which did not feature before, have been put forward.\n            Disputes flared up over the ownership of nine oil wells in Kyrgyzstan\u2019s Leilek district. In June 2013, an\n            oil and gas deposit, No. 205, which Tajikistan considered as theirs, was called into dispute after 22 years\n            of post-independence exploitation. This surge coincided with advances in border delimitation when it\n            approached Leilek. Overall, 35 infrastructure objects were claimed by Tajikistan. Year 2015 witnessed a\n            return to the relative peace \u2014 ten incidents each took place on Kyrgyzstan\u2019s borders with Tajikistan and\n            Uzbekistan respectively.<sup id=\"xref49\"><a href=\"#fn49\">49<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196981122368\">The April 2013 violence between Voruh and Ak-Sai was a momentous event and is\n            examined as a case study. It started with an attempt to build a bypass road. The road story carries a deep\n            fear behind it, as roads are powerful sites for enacting territorial integrity.<sup id=\"xref50\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn50\">50<\/a><\/sup> In areas where the formal border is not visibly demarcated, it is the road\n            that serves as the <i>de facto<\/i> site of state territorial control, along which posts can be sited.<sup\n                    id=\"xref51\"><a href=\"#fn51\">51<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196981119600\">Although Voruh is an enclave on the map, in reality, its borders were open. Free\n            movement took place most time, with nearby forests and foothills of Kyrgyzstan being accessible. The main\n            external road went through the Kyrgyz territory, while the Kyrgyz had to traverse Voruh with their livestock\n            to access the pastures beyond the enclave. Passage problems mounted, and in 2011, Kyrgyz municipalities\n            complained to the then-President Otunbayeva about beatings of shepherds and theft of livestock herded\n            through Voruh. The government allocated funding to build a bypass. The Kyrgyz side was confident that they\n            were within their rights to do so: the new road was at a 500\u00a0m distance from the disputed borderline and did\n            not contravene the ruling on construction moratorium within 200\u00a0m of it.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196981116880\">The Voruh Tajiks suspected a sinister motive behind the project, thinking that a\n            state would not spend 30 million KGS (Kyrgyzstani Som) just for a cattle road. They perceived that the\n            proposed bypass was to create a semicircle around Voruh, establishing a <i>de facto<\/i> border, along which\n            Kyrgyz border guards could be stationed. The other semicircle is formed by rocks and high mountains. Thus,\n            the road would entrap the Tajik community inside the enclave, reduce pasture access and enforce Kyrgyz\n            border defences. The \u201cunder siege\u201d sense prompted mobilisation against a collective threat.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196981115536\">The Kyrgyz official line was to provide unobstructed access, but the sentiment behind\n            was different. A Batken administration official expressed that \u201cwe want independence.

Force was displayed later when officials got\n            involved. Gulru Kayumova, Isfara deputy head, who arrived to resolve the standoff accompanied by three\n            Voruh-stationed troops, was astonished to be met by a whole Kyrgyz squad.<sup id=\"xref54\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn54\">54<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980562192\">The incident triggered a chain reaction when communities blocked roads elsewhere to\n            support their kin. A tense standoff occurred between Ak-Tatyr and Khoja-i Alo. The Tajik authorities warned\n            that their citizens intended to attack the Tamdyk\/Bedak border post, in their view illegally installed, and\n            they were powerless to prevent it. <i>Marshrutka<\/i> drivers \u2014 public transport has been operated by the\n            Tajik side \u2014 avoided taking Kyrgyz-looking passengers because Tajik vigilante groups stopped vehicles and\n            beat Kyrgyz men. Ramifications were felt throughout the year in the wider area as the sense of insecurity\n            increased.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980560816\">What changed the equilibrium by 2013 were the renewed attempts to establish the\n            border and an expansion of security presence in the preceding years. Securitisation of the Kyrgyz\u2013Tajik\n            border took place in the decade 2003\u20132013, when troops equipped with modern weapons and uniforms started to\n            be used against civilians herding sheep, cutting timber and smuggling consumer goods. Security became one of\n            the primary factors forcing fortification and militarisation of borders,<sup id=\"xref55\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn55\">55<\/a><\/sup> while the disproportionate display of force that characterises Ferghana\n            Valley frontiers carries an additional performative function symbolising expression of national sovereignty.\n        <\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980559056\">Securitisation emerged as a threat in its own right, with a culture of force\n            projection, in which minor violations make civilians a \u201clegitimate\u201d target for shoot to kill. Use of\n            firearms became common.<sup id=\"xref56\"><a href=\"#fn56\">56<\/a><\/sup> Each year people (mostly Tajik) have\n            been killed in border areas. While in the past, inter-community disputes were resolved by a combination of\n            mediation and pressure from the authorities, presently the parties more readily turn to law enforcement\n            structures for support. Disputes escalate more rapidly when border guards get involved. This has created an\n            atmosphere of grievances, which adversely affects inter-communal relations.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196985321472\">Security incidents spiralled further securitisation. In response to the April 2013\n            clashes, the state reinforced the defences of Tajik municipalities. On 10th May, a police station was\n            established in Voruh, which previously had one community policeman for 30,000 inhabitants: crime was low and\n            the communities largely managed it themselves. A branch of the State Security Committee was set up. Voruh\n            used to have only eight stationed border troops, but then reinforcements were sent to match the neighbour\u2019s\n            capabilities. The Kyrgyz side motivated their security deployment by demography: their citizens were\n            outnumbered and vulnerable and thus in the need of protection by the state. It increased the militarisation\n            of the Ak-Sai\u2013Samarkandek area, with around 300 troops contributed by different agencies. A military\n            contingent in Ak-Sai was reinforced with border troops and special forces, and squads were deployed along\n            the Voruh\u2013Samarkandek perimeter.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196985320208\">Tensions only increased and the outcomes did not take long, as armed hostilities\n            erupted on 11 January 2014, when security and border structures subjected each other to mortar and\n            grenade-launchers\u2019 fire.<sup id=\"xref57\"><a href=\"#fn57\">57<\/a><\/sup> Insecurity gripped the communities\n            after the firefight, and men with local roots flocked to the area to support their kin. Kyrgyz and Tajik men\n            organised night patrols, burning fires to signal their presence at the border. Civilians on the Kyrgyz side\n            patrolled together with troops. Field visits to Samarkandek in February 2014 revealed that about 300 men\n            went on patrols every night. Three-echelon defences were set up on the Tajik side, growing in strength as\n            they got closer to the borderline at Khoja-i Alo, for which young men were specially selected. A detachment\n            of former field commander Shoh Iskandarov was believed to appear in the area to man the defences and train\n            Tajik men in combat techniques. Firearms became noticeable. Possession is legal in Kyrgyzstan as long as\n            civilians have their rifles registered, but their overt display was unusual.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196981773952\">The situation de-escalated since its peak in 2014, perhaps aided by a realisation\n            that a dangerous threshold was approaching and sliding into war was in nobody\u2019s interests. The Ukraine\n            crisis served as a warning example. Inter-communal relations calmed down, but the actions of the security\n            structures continue to serve as a source of grievances. They, for one, interfere with economic activities\n            and agricultural practices, which ought to be the responsibility of local authorities. In March 2013, a\n            protocol on non-interference of border guards in economic activity was signed in response to Tajik concerns\n            that troops count sheep returning from Kyrgyz pastures, but realities changed little.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196981772944\">Border deployments obstruct freedom of movement and break established patterns. When\n            agreements on removal of unilaterally placed posts, such as those along Bedak\u2013Tamdyk, were reached, they\n            were not implemented.<sup id=\"xref58\"><a href=\"#fn58\">58<\/a><\/sup> The Tajik side maintained that it did not\n            introduce new border posts, and those erected were in retaliation to the neighbour\u2019s actions. In Maksat\n            (Leilek, Kyrgyzstan), school access was at stake. A secondary school was located at <i>International\n                village<\/i>, and Kyrgyz children had to go through a Tajik checkpoint to reach it, where they were\n            reportedly harassed. The Kyrgyz authorities decided to build a separate bridge to get around it. A local\n            expert observed that \u201cif the checkpoint were removed, there would be no need to build the bridge and waste\n            money.\u201d<sup id=\"xref59\"><a href=\"#fn59\">59<\/a><\/sup> Community life does not feature in the military\n            picture, which portrays the border as almost sacrosanct. A new Kyrgyz border watch tower was erected\n            directly above a garden of a Tajik Chorkuh family, from where the soldiers observe their every move. This\n            was interpreted as an insult, as Tajik cultural sensitivity renders family life strictly private.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196981112480\">Border guards often act on the contested territories <i>as if<\/i> the border was\n            established, the population was aware of it and they had a right for control of a defined territory. Kyrgyz\n            guards have been involved in several violent incidents with Tajik civilians, who believed they were on their\n            territory, while the Kyrgyz soldiers thought otherwise. Some such incidents have resulted in fatalities:\n            this is how 18-year-old Boborizo Rizoyev, a Tajik from Chorkuh, lost his life on 6 July 2015.<sup\n                    id=\"xref60\"><a href=\"#fn60\">60<\/a><\/sup> Detention of trespassing civilians and arguments with\n            Khoja-i Alo residents resulted in protests, such as hampering road access through Kyrgyz territory to Voruh.\n            Civilians have been detained by masked gunmen \u2014 pointing machineguns at them \u2014 who demanded passports on\n            entrance to Ak-Sai and checked documents of residents at random.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196981110048\">Border enforcement is unpredictable. In most cases, the border guards are not\n            permanently stationed but operate mobile patrols and catch unlucky violators. Sometimes, they set up\n            ambushes, e.g. on market days, when locals take their produce to sell on the other side. Often an issue can\n            be resolved by talking oneself out of a situation or paying a small bribe, but the same situations may end\n            up with severe repercussions. Tajik police noted that when standoffs happen, they are faced by Kyrgyz border\n            troops rather than by the local police, with whom their relations are generally good. Kyrgyz, in turn,\n            maintain that their border guards face Tajik Interior Ministry troops and riot police rather than local\n            cops. In the end, it is unclear which agency should deal with cross-border incidents\u2014police, army special\n            forces or border guards? Is it an inter-village brawl and a police matter, or an interstate conflict and\n            border troops\u2019 responsibility?<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196981108784\">A surge in patriotism has led to the recognition of the governments by the border\n            population as the nation\u2019s protectors. The latter gained political capital out of the 2013\u20132014 events as\n            they solidified with popular will and showed force. Importantly, the crisis improved Dushanbe\u2019s political\n            standing in Isfara, where the opposition Islamic Renaissance Party used to be strong. When protests occur,\n            the troops mostly solidarise with the actions of their ethnic kin even when they are not above board and are\n            reluctant to act against them. Although police cooperates in other areas, prosecution for violence against\n            civilians from the neighbouring state is an opaque subject, even when criminal investigations take place.\n            The June 2010 events in Kyrgyzstan contributed to a culture of impunity for young men, and the lack of\n            prosecutions for cross-border incidents led to the approach being replicated on the Tajik side.<sup\n                    id=\"xref61\"><a href=\"#fn61\">61<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196981106592\">Local residents, in their turn, support their troops and provide them with food and\n            fuel. The security sector became appreciated as a protective arm of the state: \u201cIt is important that the\n            state exists, that it can protect you at a critical moment\u201d (Tajik respondent). However, this does not go\n            far enough: \u201cif only laws denying them rights to our resources were implemented and our security structures\n            enforced them, many problems would be solved\u201d (Kyrgyz respondent). Relations between communities and troops\n            are fairly close. Villagers help with maintenance: in Tajikistan, <i>dehkan<\/i> (farmer) enterprises make up\n            for the deficient state funds by providing supplies for servicemen. One interviewed community-based\n            organisation rendered, as they put, \u201chumanitarian aid\u201d of 700\u00a0kg of beetroot to border guards in Bobojon\n            Gaffurov district.<sup id=\"xref62\"><a href=\"#fn62\">62<\/a><\/sup> In Ak-Sai, servicemen were deployed in\n            private homes due to shortages of barracks and got embedded into community life.<sup id=\"xref63\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn63\">63<\/a><\/sup> However, border structures are vulnerable to direct action. One reason for\n            their deployment in large numbers is that in the past, civilians had seized weapons from troops and police\n            when they outnumbered them.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980938144\">Communities have emerged as actors in their own right and are not easily tamed by the\n            state. Khoja-i Alo became the lead activist on the Tajik side, and 1,700 people reportedly signed a petition\n            to the President, protesting against the construction of the Ak-Sai\u2013Tamdyk road in 2013. The petition was\n            also forwarded to international financial institutions, such as the World Bank, the European Bank of\n            Reconstruction and Development and the Asian Development Bank, who were believed to finance the road. Kyrgyz\n            communities went further and, in May 2014, detained high-level officials such as the Deputy Prime Minister\n            Abdurahman Mambetaliev and Deputy Interior Minister Kursan Asanov, from whom they demanded better protection\n            from their Tajik nemesis. Although tensions have de-escalated since, the community power hardly diminished:\n            e.g. in 2016, it was not clear whether local villagers or the state was behind the continuation of the road\n            closure in Samarkandek.<sup id=\"xref64\"><a href=\"#fn64\">64<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980936096\">Hence, a paradox has emerged: communities seek more security, which an established\n            border should supply, and at the same time, as Kuzmits observes, \u201cthe history of transnational and\n            translocal interrelations has not rendered the border as a frontier on the local populations\u2019 mental\n            maps.\u201d<sup id=\"xref65\"><a href=\"#fn65\">65<\/a><\/sup> Borders have not been internalised and are widely viewed\n            as contradicting common sense. In the words of a Kyrgyz border commander Saitjan Eratov, \u201cTajiks graze their\n            livestock on our lands as they used to do, but we are obliged to erect barriers.

Here, considerations of higher state order\n            come into the picture. They concern security, such as combating drug trafficking, terrorism and\n            transnational criminality, and economy including collection of customs duties and transit fees at the\n            borders, as well as preventing smuggling. Geopolitics of state sovereignty and new statehood drive towards\n            marking the territory as one\u2019s own, whereas defined borders serve as an expression of that sovereignty. At\n            the same time, it can be argued that randomly, but brutally patrolled borders, which in large measure are\n            <i>de facto<\/i> open, poorly meet these aims. Better results might be achieved by less obstructive means\n            lenient on local populations, such as through improved security cooperation or by filling customs\n            declarations at source.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980738064\">The history of official ties dates back to January 1993 when the Protocol\n            establishing diplomatic relations between the two states was signed. The main documents regulating\n            interstate relations are the Dushanbe Treaty on the Interstate Relations between the Republic of Tajikistan\n            and the Kyrgyz Republic of 12 July 1996 and the Treaty on Good Neighbourly Relations and Partnership of 26\n            May 2004, while 88 legal agreements were concluded altogether.<sup id=\"xref67\"><a href=\"#fn67\">67<\/a><\/sup>\n            Still, high-level visits have been infrequent: Imomali Rahmon travelled to Kyrgyzstan only thrice on a\n            bilateral basis, and the presidents mostly meet at multilateral regional summits, such as the Commonwealth\n            of Independent States (CIS), Collective Security Treaty Organisation, Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and\n            other international fora. The Kyrgyz Prime Minister Sooronbai Jeenbekov visited Tajikistan in May 2016, but\n            the expected documents were not signed reportedly due to disagreements over border issues.<sup\n                    id=\"xref68\"><a href=\"#fn68\">68<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980735120\">The Almaty Declaration (December 1991) and the June 1992 CIS Charter form the legal\n            basis for post-USSR border settlement, the progress of which has been slow. The Intergovernmental\n            Delimitation and Demarcation (Parity) Commission was established to address these issues and its protocols\n            provide for the legal regulations of border relations. The landmark 2008 Joint Statement by the presidents\n            Bakiev and Rahmon serves as a guide to addressing practical issues in lieu of a pending bilateral border\n            treaty, <i>inter alia<\/i> stipulating a moratorium on economic activity on the contested lands.<sup\n                    id=\"xref69\"><a href=\"#fn69\">69<\/a><\/sup> An important bilateral agreement on pasture lease is\n            pending since 2008, leaving Tajik farmers with no state-guaranteed provisions for grazing animals on the\n            other side.<sup id=\"xref70\"><a href=\"#fn70\">70<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196981012592\">Dushanbe is interested in cooperation with Bishkek as its least problematic\n            neighbour, especially in the light of unpromising relations with Uzbekistan. In 2010, President Rahmon\n            declared Kyrgyzstan a \u201cfriend and relative\u201d of the Tajik nation. Institutional cooperation mechanisms have\n            been developed, such as between migration services, state registrars, water utilities boards and law\n            enforcement. An Interstate Coordination Council was set up and Security Councils hold regular meetings. The\n            Batken and Soghd oblast administrations established thematic working groups and, in 2011, an action plan\n            between the two was adopted. However, negotiations over pasture fees delayed signing of the 2013\u20132017\n            cooperation agreement.<sup id=\"xref71\"><a href=\"#fn71\">71<\/a><\/sup> More recently, cooperation on the oblast\n            and district levels became more problematic because \u201cstate strengthening\u201d encouraged the drive towards\n            bureaucratic centralisation, with an implication that minor border incidents, such as livestock theft, have\n            to be dealt through diplomatic channels involving ministries of foreign affairs instead of bordering\n            municipal authorities. Tajikistan\u2019s government system is highly centralised, with compulsory approval by the\n            central bodies of local agreements, and therefore is very slow.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196981010112\">Efforts to agree on the borderline have been ongoing since 1999. However,\n            negotiations have moved little in substance since 2002, as the two sides dispute which maps should form the\n            legal ground: Dushanbe appeals to priority and duration arguments, whereas Bishkek to <i>de facto<\/i>\n            settlement at the end of the USSR. Various zigzags to change the Commission\u2019s composition and status, e.g.\n            have it chaired by deputy premiers or involve community representatives, and the exploration of Moscow\n            archives has achieved little. Former president Roza Otunbayeva, in her account, recalled that President\n            Rahmon was reluctant to even discuss the border settlement.<sup id=\"xref72\"><a href=\"#fn72\">72<\/a><\/sup>\n            According to the Soghd oblast administration, the Parity Commission solved the problems in Ovchi-Kalacha in\n            2011, but the field visit revealed that this was not the case.<sup id=\"xref73\"><a href=\"#fn73\">73<\/a><\/sup>\n            In 2012, the Commission met 12 times but made no progress on any point.<sup id=\"xref74\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn74\">74<\/a><\/sup> In August 2013, one problem area in Ganchi (Jabbor Rasulov district) was\n            delimited.

However, as the idea was\n            leaked in the press, the Tajik border communities expressed their opposition.<sup id=\"xref76\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn76\">76<\/a><\/sup> The Tajik authorities backtracked, apprehensive of stirring public\n            passions.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196981003264\">What makes the situation especially interesting is that the border communities can\n            show the state the limitations of its power. This is because the authorities essentially share the patriotic\n            feelings of their compatriots living at the borders, and only a sense of public duty urges them to exercise\n            restraint.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196981002656\">Isfara is one of the few places in Tajikistan where the officials actively seek\n            community cooperation rather than resort to command methods. So far, the Soghd administration had faith in\n            their ability to control their population: \u201cso far our communities are manageable.\u201d<sup id=\"xref77\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn77\">77<\/a><\/sup> Still, my interviews with community representatives on both sides indicate\n            that they regard their own authorities as ineffective, cautious, unwilling to stand up for their land, slow\n            to react to grievances and quick to make concessions. Border populations demand a more assertive policy\n            towards the neighbour.<\/p>\n\n        <div class=\"blockquote\"><a id=\"idm140196981000864\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a>\n\n            <p class=\"first\" id=\"idm140196981000704\">Why the society hated the authorities? Because they constantly tell\n                us that all problems should be resolved peacefully. \u201cThis is a road of life.

The governments have turned their attention to improving conditions in the border\n            territories to enhance their citizens\u2019 stake in them and entrench their presence as a \u201ccollective border\n            guard.\u201d Otunbayeva\u2019s presidency sealed the link between border and security, and Bishkek was the first to\n            invest into segregation.<sup id=\"xref79\"><a href=\"#fn79\">79<\/a><\/sup> A law on the Status and Development of\n            Border Territories was adopted in July 2011, aimed at \u201cstrengthening national security guarantees,\n            territorial integrity and impermeability of state border.\u201d It stipulated tax concessions and other benefits\n            for the population.<sup id=\"xref80\"><a href=\"#fn80\">80<\/a><\/sup> Social and economic development plan for 55\n            Batken settlements was approved. Following the same pattern, Tajikistan allocated subsidies from the central\n            budget to Isfara when it was headed by Rahmonali Amirov and invested into social infrastructure in border\n            municipalities, with a focus on young people, such as building new stadiums.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980766224\">From the national interest perspective, Tajikistan\u2019s hand is constrained because of\n            Kyrgyzstan\u2019s capacity to inflict unilateral damage, if it chooses to do so. This was demonstrated after the\n            January 2014 shootout, which triggered a border closure by Bishkek and contributed to the neighbour\u2019s\n            isolation. Bishkek gained a leverage, after which Dushanbe quickly agreed on the construction of the Voruh\n            bypass, and solutions were found for separate Ak-Sai\u2013Tamdyk and Kulundu\u2013Maksat roads in exchange for border\n            opening. However, this leverage existed as long as Tajik-Uzbek relations remained poor, but situation has\n            changed following the death of the first president of Uzbekistan Islam Karimov. Tashkent indicated its\n            willingness to restore positive interaction; the move which was met in Dushanbe with great hope. If the\n            relations indeed improve, Tajikistan\u2019s hand will be strengthened and it may be able to restore transit via\n            Uzbekistan\u2019s route. The significance of Kyrgyzstan would scale down, and Dushanbe\u2019s negotiation position\n            would be tougher and more assertive, if it gets alternative options.<sup id=\"xref81\"><a href=\"#fn81\">81<\/a><\/sup>\n        <\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980764032\">Enclaves remain the most intricate issue. Altogether, there are about 70 enclaves in\n            the Ferghana Valley divided among Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, and five of them are sizeable. From\n            the onset, preservation of the enclaves appeared unsustainable, but they became a fact of life, while the\n            states invested resources, manpower and political capital into their continuous existence. Although the\n            enclaves act as smouldering sparks and have already led to violence in 2013 in Sokh (Uzbekistan) and Voruh,\n            the states are unwilling to give the territories up, as considerations of national pride got entrenched\n            while regional relations worsened. Making territorial concessions does not fit into this logic.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980763024\">The international politics of securitisation has contributed to materialisation of\n            boundaries in new ways<sup id=\"xref82\"><a href=\"#fn82\">82<\/a><\/sup> and has produced far-reaching political\n            consequences. Inadvertently, assistance programmes have facilitated border and security deployments without\n            a clear rationale. In 2003, the European Union (EU) \u2014 under the Austrian presidency \u2014 initiated a multiyear\n            Border Management in Central Asia (BOMCA) programme<sup id=\"xref83\"><a href=\"#fn83\">83<\/a><\/sup> aimed at\n            strengthening borders inside Central Asia. The programme was the exact opposite of the EU\u2019s philosophy of\n            open borders and free movement. Moreover, it too readily assumed that the borders existed, while in reality\n            many were undefined.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980760224\">International involvement influenced the authorities\u2019 determination to go ahead with\n            formal borders, rationalising this by security considerations. However, international programmes contributed\n            little to stopping crime, drugs and illegal migration, as patchy and poorly policed borders hardly act as an\n            impediment for drug traffickers and organised crime. Weapons are being seized in borderlands: in 2014,\n            Kyrgyzstani security structures apprehended one aviation bomb, Mukha light anti-tank rocket and two unguided\n            missiles, apparently obsolete Soviet-era armaments,<sup id=\"xref84\"><a href=\"#fn84\">84<\/a><\/sup> but it is\n            unclear whether the physical border plays any role in this.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980758448\">BOMCA and a similar US Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) programme\n            were seen by the governments at the time as gigantic moneybags that promised expensive equipment and\n            assistance with checkpoint construction. The states only had to create them to be able to receive the\n            benefits. Building of checkpoints unrolled where none existed and border protection strategies got adopted.\n            At times, international agencies were at loggerheads as both sought to assist the same checkpoints, such as\n            on the Kyrgyz\u2013Tajik border in 2004.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980757600\">Eventually, most of the international border assistance to Tajikistan became\n            concentrated on the Afghan frontier, and its northern border was receiving less attention. The situation was\n            the opposite in Kyrgyzstan, where Batken oblast bordering Tajikistan and Uzbekistan was prioritised. This\n            difference transpires in the contrast between the Kyrgyz Kyzylbel checkpoint constructed with international\n            funds and the impoverished Tajik Guliston where border staff reportedly supported themselves by breeding\n            rabbits. In 2013, BOMCA assisted Batken with border patrol towers with EXBS funding and procured night\n            vision and day surveillance equipment for its border guards, as well as 20 bicycles for cycle patrols.<sup\n                    id=\"xref85\"><a href=\"#fn85\">85<\/a><\/sup> Tajikistan\u2019s Soghd oblast got next to nothing, as it was\n            not prioritised within the country. Unsurprisingly, Tajik border communities were resentful of what they\n            perceived as preferential international treatment of the Kyrgyz.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980755456\">BOMCA contributed to border-crossing facilities but was ineffective in curbing bulk\n            drug transit<sup id=\"xref86\"><a href=\"#fn86\">86<\/a><\/sup> and several checkpoints later became effectively\n            redundant. Some were closed by Uzbekistan to citizens of the neighbouring states. Field observation at Patar\n            checkpoint on the Uzbek\u2013Tajik border in Konibodom showed that five people crossed in seven hours. The\n            programme promoted joint management at the Kazakh\u2013Kyrgyz Ak Jol border crossing, but the two sides fell back\n            on separate controls until Kyrgyzstan\u2019s EEU accession abolished customs altogether.<\/p><\/div>\n    <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm140196980753680\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a>\n\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">What does the future bear?<\/h3>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980753184\">As the governments are unwilling to pressurise their communities too hard into a\n            difficult compromise, the default option is to maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>. International conflict\n            mitigation programmes, interpreted by Bichsel<sup id=\"xref87\"><a href=\"#fn87\">87<\/a><\/sup> as \u201chegemonic\u201d\n            and treating a non-existent illness, have contributed to the maintenance of the <i>status quo<\/i>, albeit\n            without proclaiming their aim as such. <i>Status quo<\/i> appears as the least bad option, but it experiences\n            challenges, such as new security deployments, proliferation of checkpoints as revenue-generating\n            opportunities at crossings, building of new infrastructure and attempts at cultivation of contested lands.\n            <i>Status quo<\/i> management requires the commitment of both parties and cannot function if one gets\n            determined to establish the border, while the other prefers a grey zone. It needs constant maintenance of\n            peace in the absence of a solution, including local officials\u2019 dialogue and trust between them, exercise of\n            restraint by border guards, developmental measures, ongoing international monitoring and political\n            engagement of the capitals. Weakening of some of these components can slide the border region into new\n            violence.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980748944\">Ultimately, the states will have to decide which functions they want their borders to\n            carry. In Kuzmits\u2019s<sup id=\"xref88\"><a href=\"#fn88\">88<\/a><\/sup> terminology, this could be <i>military,<\/i>\n            with hard security deployments; <i>economic<\/i>, meant to generate revenue through customs duties; <i>policing,<\/i>\n            intended to combat transnational threats such as drugs and terrorism; or <i>identity,<\/i> by drawing\n            nationhood lines. A future strategic choice appears to be between a solution based on open borders, joint\n            jurisdiction of the densely populated territories and preservation of common economic and social spaces, or\n            by establishment of a closed border regime modelled on Uzbekistan. The former would require goodwill and\n            imagination of the governments, while the latter will demand a greater degree of repression than the states\n            are inclined to.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980745280\">Rather than encourage the \u201cstrong fences make good neighbours\u201d thinking, we need a\n            creative approach of shared sovereignty in order to transform seemingly intractable territorial disputes\n            into sustainable peace.<sup id=\"xref89\"><a href=\"#fn89\">89<\/a><\/sup> The joint jurisdiction of two states\n            over the Isfara\/Batken area can bring significant gains in human security. This will require a special\n            status for the territory, from which checkpoints would be withdrawn to the outside perimeter. The parties\n            would commit themselves to deploy only police with non-lethal weapons and abstain from sending troops unless\n            in a national emergency. Joint police patrols would combat illicit woodcutting and livestock theft.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980743408\">Considerable political will of the leaderships is required to put a joint\n            jurisdiction solution into practice, alter the constitutions and harmonise legislations. In that way,\n            everyday social and economic activity can proceed unimpeded and community interaction would be preserved.\n            The presently disputed lands will be cultivated either split in equal measure or used on the basis of\n            individual lease contracts. Harmonisation of land codes, laws regulating property ownership and inheritance,\n            and use of pastures will need to follow, so that contracts are valid on both sides. Medical facilities would\n            be open for local residents irrespective of citizenship. Schools can be supervised by the respective\n            ministries of education, with compulsory classes in each other\u2019s languages.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980742320\">Presently, high-minded statehood considerations, influenced by the notion that the\n            state ought to be \u201cstrong,\u201d prevent low-key practical solutions, while pressures on the ground are mounting.\n            The alternative option is for the two presidents to use their power to order a border division that may go\n            through settlements but would present a viable defence line, along which border installations can be\n            erected. The Uzbekistan\u2013Turkmenistan border was drawn in such a scenario in 2002\u20132004 and many ethnic Uzbeks\n            chose to resettle to their kin state.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980741456\">This scenario is fantastic in the Kyrgyzstan\u2013Tajikistan context. Unwillingness to\n            settle the border by a concerted use of force is telling about the nature of political systems. However\n            authoritarian Tajikistan might be in other respects, the regime is not confident in its ability to control\n            the population in the case of mass border protests. It is apprehensive of the popular reaction and sensitive\n            to the expression of dissent when it comes to border issues. The political order in Kyrgyzstan relies on\n            popular legitimacy and is averse to imposing solutions against the will of the Kyrgyz majority. Kyrgyz\n            politicians drew a lesson on how border concessions can backfire from the events in Aksy in 2002 when six\n            people died in a dispute sparkled by the transfer of a piece of unpopulated territory to China.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980930752\">As the two states were locked in their border dilemma, EEU expansion was a new factor\n            in this complicated context. In 2014, a mission of Russian security officials that came to the south of\n            Kyrgyzstan to assess the border situation was confident in their ability to tackle it: \u201cWe can do anything.\n            We are not traffic police\u201d (<i>\u041c\u044b \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043c. \u041c\u044b \u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0413\u0410\u0418<\/i>).<sup id=\"xref90\"><a href=\"#fn90\">90<\/a><\/sup>\n            Interviews with local observers in south Kyrgyzstan in 2014\u20132015 indicate that communities also had high\n            expectations that Moscow will look after their interests acting as an ultimate arbiter to rectify the\n            excesses of local powerholders. \u201cWhen people start talking about Russia, it is as if they have a third eye\n            opening\u201d(<i>\u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0438 \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0442 \u043e \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438, \u0443 \u043d\u0438\u0445 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0437 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f<\/i>).<sup id=\"xref91\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn91\">91<\/a><\/sup> This feeling is reinforced by TV coverage: \u201cwe are being told through TV\n            that our lives would be easier.

Although the issues on the ground are not new, more\n            people participate in incidents, and the events at the border acquire a wider national resonance. Given the\n            capacity of border communities to mobilise quickly in the case of perceived threat, a danger that seemingly\n            small disputes may get out of hand is real.<sup id=\"xref97\"><a href=\"#fn97\">97<\/a><\/sup> The mechanisms of\n            coping with the risks \u2014 community resilience, state capacities and conflict management structures in the\n            wider Eurasian region \u2014 are insufficient. Left unaddressed, cross-border problems are capable of leading to\n            disturbances, serious security incidents and international ramifications.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980916320\">The wider Eurasian context is still shaping and the exercise of new sovereignty in\n            its borderland incarnation is a part of this evolving picture. While the separation drive has affected the\n            whole of Central Asia, the smaller and weaker states of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are unprepared to pay a\n            considerable price for it in terms of domestic politics and also materially by erecting border\n            installations. Establishment of a security regime on the Kyrgyz\u2013Tajik border has run into problems as it was\n            confronted by a microcosm of local relations, chessboard settlement patterns and interdependencies, and\n            exacerbated tensions.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980915392\">After 25 years of independence, two trends are challenging the <i>status quo<\/i> of\n            tense coexistence on undefined territories. One is the emergence of borderland identities with strong ethnic\n            and \u201cnation\u2019s protector\u201d connotations, reinforced by generation change and the new statehood ideologies. The\n            other is a precarious feeling of collective insecurity even at the time of relative tranquility, with\n            awareness that disruption may be around the corner. \u201cDivided we rise\u201d mood dominates.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980914032\">None of this helps to resolve the border dilemma. Abandoning a hard border regime and\n            \u201czero-sum\u201d delimitation efforts can be the best way out of the fragile situation, but there are no\n            precedents for it in the Eurasian context, and its political culture is not conducive to it. Therefore, the\n            borderlands would continue with their \u201cin flux\u201d existence until either a crisis of some magnitude forces\n            resolution or a new generation of politicians would accept that delimitation efforts have run into an\n            impasse and seek different ways to satisfy their security as well as economic and geopolitical\n            interests.<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"article-back\" class=\"back\">\n    <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm140196980912960\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a>\n\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Declaration of interest<\/h3>\n\n        <p id=\"idm140196980912176\">Anna Matveeva declares that she has no conflict of interest.<\/p><\/div>\n    <h3 class=\"main-title\">Funding sources<\/h3>\n\n    <p>The UNDP Country Office in Kyrgyzstan funded the fieldwork in the Ferghana Valley.<\/p>\n\n    <div class=\"back-section\"><a id=\"idm320522076736\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a>\n\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Footnotes<\/h3>\n\n        <div class=\"reference-container\" id=\"fn1\">\n            <div>\n                <div class=\"pull-left\"><strong><span class=\"generated\">1<\/span><\/strong><\/div>\n                <div class=\"ref-content\">Madeleine Reeves in Bruce Pannier, \u201cMajlis podcast: Mapping conflict along\n                    Ferghana Valley\u2019s borders,\u201d <i>Radio Free Europe\/Radio Liberty<\/i>, 3 April 2016, <a target=\"_blank\"\n                                                                                                         href=\"http:\/\/www.rferl.org\/content\/majlis-podcast-mapping-conflict-along-ferghana-valley-borders\/27651487.html#hash=relatedInfoContainer\"\n                                                                                                         id=\"idm320522075056\">http:\/\/www.rferl.org\/content\/majlis-podcast-mapping-conflict-along-ferghana-valley-borders\/27651487.html#hash=relatedInfoContainer<\/a>.\n                <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <ul class=\"ref-links\">\n                <li><i class=\"fa fa-arrow-circle-up\" aria-hidden=\"true\"\/><a href=\"#xref1\">Back to the article<\/a><\/li>\n            <\/ul>\n        <\/div>\n        <div class=\"reference-container\" id=\"fn2\">\n            <div>\n                <div class=\"pull-left\"><strong><span class=\"generated\">2<\/span><\/strong><\/div>\n                <div class=\"ref-content\">Christine Bichsel, <i>Conflict Transformation in Central Asia: Irrigation\n                    Disputes in the Ferghana Valley<\/i> (London: Routledge, 2009).\n                <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <ul class=\"ref-links\">\n                <li><i class=\"fa fa-arrow-circle-up\" aria-hidden=\"true\"\/><a href=\"#xref2\">Back to the article<\/a><\/li>\n            <\/ul>\n        <\/div>\n        <div class=\"reference-container\" id=\"fn3\">\n            <div>\n                <div class=\"pull-left\"><strong><span class=\"generated\">3<\/span><\/strong><\/div>\n                <div class=\"ref-content\">For examination of this issue, see Timur Dadabaev, \u201cSecuring Central Asian\n                    frontiers: Institutionalisation of borders and inter-state relations,\u201d <i>Strategic Analysis<\/i>,\n                    2012, 36 (4): 554\u2013568, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1080\/09700161.2012.689526\"\n                                              id=\"idm320522071008\">https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1080\/09700161.2012.689526<\/a>;

the\n                    Aksai\u2013Tamdyk\u2013Chuurgan Baba Highway. The Kyrgyz border communities\u2019 demands for visiting President\n                    Otunbayeva were to (1) build a separate road, (2) bring the border commander Bakhtiyor Mamyrov back,\n                    and (3) stop petrol sales to the Tajik side. She stated that \u201crelations between the citizens of\n                    neighbouring countries have become so strained that it was decided to build a bypassing road around\n                    Tajik territories.

Author defines symbolic violence as a practice, manifested in deliberate action of a given diplomatic actor to damage his adversary\u2019s reputation, status and dignity through a certain set of actions, such as linguistic violence (e.g., insult, intimidation), disobeying diplomatic tact and so forth. This study aims to examine whether it is possible to establish how a change in practice (in the example of Russia\u2013Turkey relations before and after the downing of the Russian fighter plane Su-24) originates, utilising an alternative practice \u2013 theoretical toolkit \u2013 contradictory framing of the past. To achieve this, the author examines what potentially might cause a change in practice in the Russia\u2013Turkish case and to what extent the potential of social media can be harnessed by governments to shape public opinion and influence diplomatic actors\u2019 international reputation. The methodology employed was based on previous practice and framing studies that have perfected the tools necessary for the detection and analysis of frames. In this research, these tools were employed on 140-character-long tweets. Identifying general themes was achieved through thematic analysis, the method for identifying, analyzing and reporting on patterns, or themes, within data corpus. The paper mentions that both Russia and Turkey attempted to narrate each other\u2019s behaviour through framing one another on Twitter focusing on the legitimacy and morality of each other\u2019s policies to limit the opponent\u2019s ability to carry out the latter\u2019s foreign political prerogatives. Moreover, as the Twitter analysis of the Russian and Turkish framing of one another showed, governments can and do harness the potential of using images and words as the weapons of symbolic violence when they attempt to impose their own narration on a given event or situation.<\/p><\/div>\n",

Symbols\n            are primarily used by diplomatic actors to better project the core ideas behind certain political\n            initiatives. In other words, diplomatic actors send each other certain messages about their intentions\n            through symbolic actions and interactions: the level of state representation in the country of arrival,\n            official gifts, ceremonies and so forth. Non-observance of diplomatic rituals and norms is perceived by the\n            other side as an insult. Consequently, it may cause complications in bilateral relations. For this reason,\n            symbolism is an indispensable part of diplomatic relations. Another importance of symbolism in diplomacy is\n            explained by the fact that it helps people to have an understanding about world politics and have an insight\n            into relations between states.<sup id=\"xref2\"><a href=\"#fn2\">2<\/a><\/sup> \u201cSymbolism is one of the means of\n            social construction of states and international politics, and it allows people to deal with states as real\n            entities, not just as abstract concepts. The state as an abstract concept cannot mobilize people and has\n            little affective power or appeal to the masses and individuals.\u201d<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm139973199389920\">As it can be inferred from the aforementioned idea, symbolism helps people to\n            socially construct their perceptions of states and international affairs resting upon their personal\n            knowledge and experience. From the perspective of international practice theory, along with the cost\u2013benefit\n            analysis that politicians make in their calculations, the strategic interaction of states is significantly\n            affected by the ideas and knowledge of the people involved and the discourse they use to communicate.<sup\n                    id=\"xref3\"><a href=\"#fn3\">3<\/a><\/sup> To develop their analysis goes far beyond abovementioned\n            factors: they maintain the idea that states\u2019 actions and their interactions towards each other are\n            constituted by the practices they share.<sup id=\"xref4\"><a href=\"#fn4\">4<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm139973199409728\">This research paper goes beyond Bourdieusian perspective of practice in explaining\n            the cause of change in practice. Bourdieusian habitus formed from the past experiences cannot fully grasp\n            the way changes originate from practice. Therefore, an alternative theoretical interpretation proposed in\n            this paper, the contradictory framing of the past, can be instrumental in explaining the change in practice.\n            The methodology employed in this paper was based on previous framing studies that have perfected the tools\n            necessary for the detection and analysis of frames in the offline world such as Entman\u2019s<sup id=\"xref5\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn5\">5<\/a><\/sup> definition of framing and Semetko and Valkenburg\u2019s<sup id=\"xref6\"><a\n                    href=\"#fn6\">6<\/a><\/sup> tools for the detection of generic frames. In this research, however, these\n            tools were employed on 140-character-long tweets rather than newspaper articles or televised newscasts.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm139973199316096\">Following the tragedy of 9\/11, international community once again realized the need\n            to consolidate efforts on a global war against terrorism. There emerged a number of fields \u2014 arenas for\n            state actors \u2014 that concentrated international military operations: Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria and some\n            others. International communities, especially states that faced terrorist acts on their own territories,\n            evaluated the importance of deploying troops of coalition forces in the war against terrorism. In\n            particular, the escalating Syrian crisis, where Western coalition forces along with those from Russia and\n            Turkey conducted military operations against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Islamist\n            militants located in the country, illustrates this. In this paper, we look at a change in practice in the\n            example of Russian\u2013Turkish relations before and after the downing of the Russian fighter plane Su-24 by\n            Turkey. In this paper, we elaborate this point empirically, resting upon an alternative practice \u2013\n            theoretical point \u2014 contradictory framing of the past and through framing analysis.<\/p>\n\n        <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139973199330784\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Research\n            questions<\/h4>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199329808\">Research question 1 was defined as follows: How can the cause of change in\n                practice be explained in the example of Russian and Turkish relations following the downing of the\n                Russian pilot of Su-24? To respond to this question, we have approached an alternative mechanism for\n                change in practices \u2014 contradictory framing of the past. To do this, we have had to analyze all tweets\n                in the given time intervals and construct a codebook for the purpose of this research. It is worthwhile\n                to mention that the given research was largely influenced and enriched by the Entman\u2019s definition of\n                framing.<sup id=\"xref7\"><a href=\"#fn7\">7<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199352592\">Research question 2 was defined as: To what extent the potential of social media\n                can be harnessed by governments to shape public opinion and influence diplomatic actors\u2019 international\n                reputation? To achieve this, the tone of messages on both the English and Russian Twitter channels of\n                Russia and Turkey were examined. Bearing in mind that the two nations often refer to one another on\n                digital technologies, we were confident Russia and Turkey would provide rich research material for the\n                purpose of this study.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199358624\">To date, many researches have been made pertaining to violence and international\n                relations (IR), yet the topic of symbolic violence and its relationship with the realm of IR has had\n                little attention from IR scholars. Bourdieu<sup id=\"xref8\"><a href=\"#fn8\">8<\/a><\/sup> developed the\n                concept of \u201csymbolic violence.\u201d After Bourdieu,<sup id=\"xref9\"><a href=\"#fn9\">9<\/a><\/sup> several other\n                publications on \u201csymbolic politics\u201d came into existence.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199331200\">In his works, Bourdieu touched upon several forms of domination<sup\n                    id=\"xref10\"><a href=\"#fn10\">10<\/a><\/sup> and pointed out that the critical outcome of them is <i>symbolic\n                violence<\/i>.<sup id=\"xref11\"><a href=\"#fn11\">11<\/a><\/sup> Speaking about the relationship between\n                symbolic violence and social reality, Bourdieu et al.<sup id=\"xref12\"><a href=\"#fn12\">12<\/a><\/sup>\n                maintain the theory that symbolic violence possesses an ability to manage social interactions, rejecting\n                the existence of social reality. The potential of symbolic violence to manage social interactions can be\n                projected to the realm of IR, where diplomatic actors may inflict symbolic violence on one another to\n                undermine each other\u2019s diplomatic activities. A potent power of symbolic violence to manage strategic\n                interactions can be illustrated in the mutual interactions of Russia and Turkey following the downing of\n                the Russian fighter plane Su-24. Both Russia and Turkey attempted to construct an image of one another\n                in a negative light by calling into question the legality of each other\u2019s actions and the credibility of\n                the regimes in these countries. Their stance effectively took the form of symbolic violence, since the\n                two parties \u2014 Russia on the one hand and Turkey on the other hand \u2014 have continuously attempted to\n                tarnish the international image and credibility of each other in the eyes of the wider international\n                community. The use of symbolic violence effects public perception and social reality. The point is that\n                hashtags, language, images and other available tools may be harnessed by governments to attack an\n                adversary\u2019s image on social media platforms. The audience on those platforms may fail to grasp the\n                quintessence of narrations consciously built by diplomatic actors to discredit one another. For this\n                reason, the general public tends to build its opinion about the parties involved in exercising symbolic\n                violence based on the information it is fed.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199311584\">According to Bourdieu and Wacquant,<sup id=\"xref13\"><a href=\"#fn13\">13<\/a><\/sup>\n                symbolic violence can be defined as the violence carried out in relation to a social agent with the\n                latter\u2019s complicity. The parties that are subject to symbolic violence regard their condition as\n                legitimate, admitting a system of values imposed on them. Developing symbolic violence, a form of social\n                domination, assumes application of meaning and ideology, manifested in the form of narrations, language\n                and images, with respect to social actors.<sup id=\"xref14\"><a href=\"#fn14\">14<\/a><\/sup> Once a given\n                diplomatic actor issues symbolic violence on his adversary through the use of posts and comments, which\n                contain insults, intimidation, disrespect and so forth, it intentionally hurts his adversary\u2019s\n                international status, reputation and honour.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199340560\">In this paper, we maintain the idea that Adler and Pouliot\u2019s Bourdieusian\n                analysis of international affairs is unable to grasp how change originates in practice. We share the\n                theorists\u2019 idea stating that practices are structured by past experiences that orient actions in the\n                present.<sup id=\"xref15\"><a href=\"#fn15\">15<\/a><\/sup> Yet in contrast to Bourdieu, we believe that\n                practices are not stable. Thus, it is hard to unequivocally point to the future merely based on the past\n                experiences. We elaborate this argument through an alternative practice \u2014 theoretical interpretation of\n                change \u2014 contradictory framing of the past and framing analysis in the empirical part.<\/p><\/div>\n        <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139973199348880\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Symbolic\n            violence and digital diplomacy<\/h4>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199350368\">Diplomacy has long acted as an indispensable instrument of foreign political\n                activity. In the course of the past several decades, it has undergone several institutional changes and\n                has become multifaceted: cultural diplomacy, public diplomacy, cyber diplomacy, digital diplomacy and so\n                forth. Moreover, the development of sophisticated information technologies has created a new platform of\n                diplomatic interaction. Several definitions of the term digital diplomacy have been proposed by\n                academics. In particular, Hanson<sup id=\"xref16\"><a href=\"#fn16\">16<\/a><\/sup> uses the term to refer to\n                the use of Internet and information and communication technologies to achieve diplomatic ends. According\n                to the Foreign Commonwealth Office, digital diplomacy is an instrument to resolve foreign policy issues.<sup\n                        id=\"xref17\"><a href=\"#fn17\">17<\/a><\/sup> Broadly speaking, digital diplomacy refers to an\n                extensive use of Internet and digital technologies by government bodies and diplomatic missions abroad\n                to monitor, inform and engage foreign public. In doing so, it heavily rests upon the potential of social\n                media, a group of web-based digital technologies such as Twitter (a microblog), Facebook, VKontakte\n                (social networking sites), YouTube, Flickr video and photo sharing and some others.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199360880\">The last decade has witnessed an increase of interest among diplomatic actors in\n                digital diplomacy in realizing their foreign political objectives. The United States, United Kingdom,\n                Germany, France, Scandinavian countries, Russia, Japan, China, India and others began to gradually\n                develop their own digital diplomacy strategy. Nowadays around two-thirds of the 193 United Nations\n                member states have Twitter accounts.<sup id=\"xref18\"><a href=\"#fn18\">18<\/a><\/sup> State\u2019s public\n                diplomacy institutions are increasingly actively using the potential of social media to engage foreign\n                publics abroad. To illustrate this point further, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs possesses its\n                own blog account and Twitter page, platforms to provide information and engage foreign publics on issues\n                related to Indian foreign policy.<sup id=\"xref19\"><a href=\"#fn19\">19<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199370896\">Today, the number of countries possessing manuals on social media use is\n                increasingly growing. For instance, the US State Department\u2019s manual on using social media is an example\n                of a document that provides guidance for the use of digital technologies for conducting foreign policy.\n                In fact, the manual is based on the State Department\u2019s social media strategy, which covers opportunities\n                and challenges to the use of social media at a contemporary stage.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199372544\">With regards to other countries, it is fair to mention the British Foreign and\n                Commonwealth Office. Since December 2010, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has been following its\n                \u201cDigital Strategy\u201d devised by the dedicated Digital Transformation Unit. The strategy envisages using\n                the potential of social media to conduct foreign political activities.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199377072\">It is not accidental that diplomatic actors attach a significant interest to\n                social media platforms. The point is that social media is an increasingly strategic communication\n                instrument of foreign policy. It can be used not only to communicate diplomatic actors\u2019 messages but\n                also to serve as a source of information, a necessary channel for dialogue with people and an instrument\n                for monitoring hot issues. In other words, making strategic use of social media means evaluating target\n                groups and intended messages, as well as identifying preferred communication channels.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199378704\">For the time being, an overt physical force has almost been replaced by symbolic\n                forms of potential power \u2014 \u201cprestige\u201d or \u201creputation.\u201d<sup id=\"xref20\"><a href=\"#fn20\">20<\/a><\/sup> In\n                that sense in the world of today, not only military, economic, political and other parameters but also\n                status and reputation of the given state by and large determine its power. Any attempt to damage another\n                diplomatic actor\u2019s reputation is regarded by the latter as an act to tarnish his international status.\n                Thus, it is of paramount importance for states to save their faces, prestige and status to be heard and\n                be respected by international community.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199389648\">Development of sophisticated information and telecommunication technologies and\n                wide penetration of Internet into the life of people brought about certain changes in diplomatic\n                practice. In many countries, government agencies and high-ranking politicians, diplomats and other group\n                of government representatives are increasingly utilizing social media to influence and shape public\n                opinion in such a way as to influence the foreign political decisions of their governments. Given the\n                wide penetration of digital technologies, social media platforms may in some cases be harnessed to\n                weaken an adversary\u2019s international credibility and image. The decision of some high-ranking politicians\n                to maintain a social media presence in the given foreign country is explained by their desire to win the\n                war for \u201chearts and minds.\u201d To achieve this, heads of states and governments launch their own account on\n                social media platforms, accruing numerous followers. In exploiting the potential of these tools,\n                politicians actively use language symbolism to attract sympathetic public.<\/p><\/div>\n        <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139973199393216\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">A case study\n            of Russian\u2013Turkish framing of each other on social media<\/h4>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199394976\">A practice explanation of strategic interaction has important implications for\n                our research on symbolic violence in digital diplomacy and more broadly with international affairs. It\n                is worth mentioning that practice theory comprises an international change component. Thus, digital\n                diplomacy as a form of international practice should not be treated merely as public diplomacy strategy;\n                rather it may act as a foreign political instrument to manage international change. To illustrate the\n                political situation in Syria in 2015, characterized by the presence of several foreign countries on the\n                territory of Syria to conduct military operations against IS, and later involvement of Russian airspace\n                forces, followed by the shift of European nations\u2019 policies from European continental\u0092issues towards\n                Russia, may be seen as a change in structural conditions.<sup id=\"xref21\"><a href=\"#fn21\">21<\/a><\/sup>\n                Consequently, these types of events, especially in times of crises, are capable of introducing changes\n                to practices.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199400656\">In this part, we are going to examine how the cause of change in practice can be\n                explained in the example of Russian and Turkish relations following the downing of the Russian pilot of\n                Su-24 and to analyze to what extent the potential of social media can be harnessed by governments to\n                shape public opinion and influence diplomatic actors\u2019 international reputation.<\/p><\/div>\n        <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139973199406112\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">The empirical\n            part of research<\/h4>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199407392\">We have seen a change in practices in relationship between Russia and Turkey\n                because of a fundamental difference in perceiving and framing the incident with the Russian pilot and\n                uncertainty for Russian policy makers whether Turkey shared their vision of ensuring security through\n                war against ISIL or whether the Turkish side showed double standards by defending their positions and\n                buying ISIL oil. In this section, we elaborate this point empirically based on an alternative practice \u2013\n                theoretical interpretation of change \u2014 contradictory framing of the past and framing analysis.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199412080\">Our proposed theoretical toolkit of contradictory framing of the past assumes\n                perceiving the given situation by political actors at individual level and framing it in the way\n                consistent with their political ambitions. In the given situation with Russian-Su-24, the two opposing\n                parties had from the outbreak of conflict their own line of argumentation for taking their stands. For\n                Turkey, the routine violations of Turkish airspace by Russia and the continued ignoring of warnings from\n                the Turkish side resulted in Turkey downing the Russian aircraft. Russia viewed the issue as a \u201cstab in\n                the back,\u201d criticizing Turkey for siding with Islamic State of Iraq and Levant. The same incident has\n                been framed differently, leading to the changes in behaviour of Russia and Turkey, introducing changes\n                to practices in Syria given time lag. For the Russian ruling elite and security practitioners, Turkey\u2019s\n                decision to down the Russian pilot violated the rules of establishing security in the region and led to\n                certain social and economic transformations in the wider Eurasian region. To illustrate, Russia imposed\n                a package of sanctions mostly of an economic and military character vis-\u00e0-vis Turkey, causing serious\n                damage to the Turkish economy and the welfare of its people. It opened up its agricultural market for\n                alternative countries like Uzbekistan, Egypt and some others to access. With regards to the character of\n                military operations in Syria, Russia concentrated its efforts on gathering intelligence data about the\n                possible relationship between the Turkish Government and ISIL and actively striking military bases and\n                camps of Islamist militants with daily information support on mass media. This reaction has been a\n                product of the Russian perception of Turkey\u2019s actions and not a shift in the objective structure of the\n                field.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199412880\">The given research explored the manner in which a dyad of countries, Russia and\n                Turkey, framed one another by focusing on English and Russian language content published by these\n                countries\u2019 official institutional accounts as well as individual accounts of some high-profile\n                politicians from both countries. Research evidence has studied the official accounts of Ministry of\n                Foreign Affairs, presidencies, governments and embassies of Russia and Turkey and Twitter accounts of\n                politicians. In total, 19 Russian accounts and 16 Turkish accounts have been analyzed in this paper.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199412592\">\n                Deriving from research questions that look at practicing symbolic violence in the context of digital\n                diplomacy as well as to enrich the methodology of the given research paper, the researcher decided to\n                refer to some recent researches focusing on government framing on social networking sites as well.<sup\n                    id=\"xref22\"><a href=\"#fn22\">22<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199407152\">To illustrate, Manor<sup id=\"xref23\"><a href=\"#fn23\">23<\/a><\/sup> explored the\n                manner in which a dyad of countries, the United States and Russia, frame one another on SNS. His\n                research encompasses a major global conflict surrounding Crimea\u2019s annexation by Russia. His analysis\n                offers important insight into government framing, i.e., the framing of foreign countries seems to be\n                influenced by the existence or absence of conflict. Manor believes that framing analysis of MFAs\u2019 SNS\n                could be used to characterize the relations that exist between specific nations. Moreover, the study\n                also revealed that the detection of generic frames in both dyads indicates that governments do in fact\n                frame one another on SNS.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199333040\">Yet his research sample was limited to English language SNS channels. Thus, it\n                was not possible to establish whether the content published by such MFAs on local language channels\n                differs from the content published on English channels. Another important limitation of his research was\n                his use of a short research period spanning just 3 months.

For this\n            purpose, a special codebook was constructed and used.<\/p>\n\n        <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139973199349088\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Codebook\n            construction<\/h4>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199355056\">A codebook was created specifically for the purposes of finding out the extent\n                that Russia and Turkey exercise symbolic violence in their digital diplomacy activities vis-\u00e0-vis each\n                other and revealing the manner they construct each other\u2019s image on social media platforms.

Each question was answered in a binary\n                manner (Yes\/No). For each tweet, the average of all four questions was calculated. Tweets scoring 0.5 on\n                the Entman scale were those that included two of the four elements of framing. Given the exploratory\n                nature of the given research, it was decided that tweets scoring 0.5 or higher on the Entman scale would\n                be regarded as tweets that meet Entman\u2019s definition of framing.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199380176\">Each tweet was analyzed to identify the following generic frames: conflict, human\n                interest, attribution of responsibility, morality and the economic consequence frame. A list of 20\n                questions were prepared with 5 questions designed to identify the responsibility and human interest, 4\n                questions for conflict frame, and 3 questions to identify the moral and economic consequence frames.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199402560\">Due to the exploratory nature of this research, only tweets that scored 0.5 or\n                higher on any generic frame scale were considered to include the relevant frame. A high score on the\n                attribution of responsibility scale (0.5 or higher) meant that one government portrayed the other as\n                responsible for a certain problem or situation. To be clear, a high score on the economic consequence\n                scale meant that one country might use financial leverage against the other and\/or a high score on the\n                conflict scale meant that tweets highlighted a conflict between two or more parties.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199402272\">In some cases, when several tweets dealt with the same topic, they were examined\n                as a single component. The Entman and Generic frames scales were evaluated by using a dichotomy of below\n                or equal and above of 0.5.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199414112\">Finally, once all the tweets had been coded and analyzed, a second phase began:\n                identifying a general topic. To achieve this, the researcher has selected certain aspects of a perceived\n                reality reflected on individual tweets and made them salient in a respective context based on their\n                repetition.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199387392\">The final stage, identifying general themes, was achieved through thematic\n                analysis, the method for identifying, analyzing and reporting on patterns, or themes, within data\n                corpus.<sup id=\"xref26\"><a href=\"#fn26\">26<\/a><\/sup> During the first phase, about 66% of all the tweets\n                (with the exception of general statements) in which one country references the other one in the dyad\n                were reviewed and categorized based on their subject matter, their underlying assumptions and ideology.\n                During the next phase, these tweets were reviewed once more to ensure the relevance of the identified\n                categories. Finally, the category with the greatest prevalence was chosen as the one that characterizes\n                the manner in which one nation in the dyad references another.<\/p><\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139973199309344\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a>\n\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Results<\/h3>\n\n        <p id=\"idm139973199296112\">Throughout the research period, Turkey was mentioned in 159 tweets published on the\n            Russia\u2019s English and Russian language Twitter channels. Of these 159 tweets, 114 were analyzed and coded as\n            the remaining tweets were general statements such as a link to a summary of meetings and statements. Of the\n            114 tweets analyzed, 19 tweets were published during the first time interval as opposed to 95 that were\n            published during the second time interval. Turkey referred to Russia in 102 tweets published during the\n            research period. Of the 102 tweets, 59 were analyzed and coded as the remaining tweets included general\n            statements. Of the 59 tweets analyzed, 10 tweets were published during first time interval as opposed to 49\n            that were published during the second time interval. These figures demonstrate that both nations referred to\n            one another more frequently following the downing of the Russian Su-24.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm139973199392688\">During both time intervals, the research corpus included tweets that scored 0 on the\n            Entman and the generic frames scales. However, several tweets as below stating the same content were\n            reviewed as one unit and were scored respectively:<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm139973199391984\">Medvedev: \u201cTurkey\u2019s criminal actions have led to three consequences.

Yet during the second time interval, the\n                downing of the Russian Su-24 damaged bilateral relations.

During the first time\n                interval, tweets that scored 0.5 or higher on the attribution scale often dealt with the different\n                strategic approaches of the two governments on Russian involvement in the Syrian crisis.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199368944\">During the second time interval, tweets scoring 0.5 or higher on the attribution\n                of responsibility scale Russia blames Turkey in criminal actions for downing the Russian Su-24. Such is\n                the case with the tweets above by the Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, which deal with the\n                consequences that resulted from the downing of a Russian pilot.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199339248\">The second most prevalent frame in Russian tweets during the first time interval\n                was the attribution of responsibility frame (42%). This generic frame was also the second most prevalent\n                frame used by Russia during the second time interval (45%). During the first time interval, tweets that\n                scored 0.5 or higher on the attribution scale dealt with fighting Kurds instead of ISIL militants to\n                retain Turkish power. During the second time interval, tweets scoring 0.5 or higher on the attribution\n                scale frame Turkey as responsible for the tensions between Russia and Turkey and for the crisis in\n                Syria.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199419888\">Tweets dealing with the downing of the Russian pilot and fighting Kurds scored\n                0.5 or higher on the human interest frame. Morality frame was the third most prevalent frame during both\n                time intervals (28% and 41% accordingly), and the fourth prevalent frame was human interest frame.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199419136\">The fifth prevalent frame used by Russia was the economic consequence frame,\n                which was not prevalent during the first time interval and 9% prevalent during the second time interval.\n                This could be result of the fact that Russia used this frame when commenting on Russian sanctions\n                imposed on Turkey, following the downing of the Russian Su-24.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199418336\">As can be seen in <a href=\"#F5\">Figures 5<\/a> and <a href=\"#F6\">6<\/a>, the most\n                prevalent generic frame used by Turkey when framing Russia during both time intervals was the conflict\n                frame (69% during first time interval and 66% during second time interval). This indicates that Turkey\n                framed Russia as its rival over approaches taken on the Syrian issue and assigning blame to Russia for\n                deteriorating bilateral relations between the two nations.<\/p>\n\n            <div class=\"container-fluid img-container\">\n                <div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F5\"\/>\n\n                    <div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\"\n                                                        src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/7398ecb3-6b10-11e6-9e6c-0242ac110003\/ad_illum_nihil_400.png\"\/>\n                    <\/div>\n                    <div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a\n                            href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/7398ecb3-6b10-11e6-9e6c-0242ac110003\/ad_illum_nihil_900.png\"\n                            class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a\n                            href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/7398ecb3-6b10-11e6-9e6c-0242ac110003\/CJES-00017-2016-02_F0005.png\"\n                            download=\"CJES-00017-2016-02_F0005.png\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download\n                        Image\n                    <\/a><\/div>\n                <\/div>\n                <div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 5<\/p>\n\n                    <div class=\"fig-description\"><i>Turkey frames Russia: Relative frequency of generic frames during\n                        the first time interval.<\/i><\/div>\n                <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"container-fluid img-container\">\n                <div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F6\"\/>\n\n                    <div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\"\n                                                        src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/7398ecb3-6b10-11e6-9e6c-0242ac110003\/inventore_quos_accusamus_400.png\"\/>\n                    <\/div>\n                    <div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a\n                            href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/7398ecb3-6b10-11e6-9e6c-0242ac110003\/inventore_quos_accusamus_900.png\"\n                            class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a\n                            href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/7398ecb3-6b10-11e6-9e6c-0242ac110003\/CJES-00017-2016-02_F0006.png\"\n                            download=\"CJES-00017-2016-02_F0006.png\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download\n                        Image\n                    <\/a><\/div>\n                <\/div>\n                <div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 6<\/p>\n\n                    <div class=\"fig-description\"><i>Turkey frames Russia: Relative frequency of generic frames during\n                        the second time interval.<\/i><\/div>\n                <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <p id=\"idm139973199327952\">The second most prevalent fame used by Turkey during both time intervals was the\n                attribution of responsibility frame (40% and 47% accordingly). This indicates that Turkey framed Russia,\n                as tweets show below, as responsible for both strikes on Syrian civilians and damaging relations between\n                Turkey and Russia.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199326224\">Presidential Spokesperson Kalin: \u201cRussian strikes in Syria do not target\n                Daesh.\u201d<sup id=\"xref29\"><a href=\"#fn29\">29<\/a><\/sup> Press Release Regarding the Targeting of Civilians\n                by Russian Air Strikes.<sup id=\"xref30\"><a href=\"#fn30\">30<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199376704\">The third most prevalent frame used by Turkey when mentioning Russia was morality\n                frame (30% and 40%, respectively). Russia used the morality frame to portray Turkey as morally bankrupt,\n                whereas Turkey used the morality frame to highlight the oppression of Crimean Tatars within the\n                framework of the illegal annexation of Crimea.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199375904\">The fourth most prevalent frame used by Turkey was the human interest frame (17%\n                and 31%, respectively). Turkey referred to this frame more than Russia during both time intervals, which\n                suggests that Turkey went to even greater lengths to portray \u201chuman face\u201d in the given issue of Syrian\n                conflict. No Turkish tweets mentioning Russia scored 0.5 or higher on the economic consequence frame\n                during the first time interval. This altered during the second time interval when Turkey referred to\n                this frame when Turkish government called for economic cooperation with Russia instead of embargoes\n                (1%).<\/p><\/div>\n        <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139973199687888\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Topics\n            addressed in tweets<\/h4>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199687120\">With regard to the topics addressed in Russian tweets mentioning Turkey, during\n                the first time interval, 37% of the tweets dealt with the situation in Syria and common efforts against\n                IS, 13% dealt with fighting Syrian Kurds by Turkey, 13% dealt with Turkish stream and trade relations,\n                11% dealt with airspace violation and Russian military involvement in Syria and 26% dealt with different\n                other topics. During the second time interval, 36% of all tweets mentioning Turkey dealt with Turkish\n                support of militants in Syria, 17% dealt with the downing of the Russian Su-24, 14% dealt with the\n                Turkish responsibility for deteriorating relations with Russia, 12% dealt with media censorship and the\n                state of democracy in Turkey, 12% other related topics and only 9% dealt with Turkey\u2019s military\n                involvement in Iraq.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199321424\">Similarly, during the first time interval, Turkish tweets referencing Russia\n                dealt with Joint meetings on bilateral cooperation and security issues (52%), accusations for targeting\n                non-DAESH groups (17%), Turkish stream and trade relations (7%), statements on mutual cooperation and\n                assistance (7%), Russian violations of Turkish airspace (3%) and other related topics (14%). During the\n                second time interval, 29% of Turkey\u2019s tweets mentioning Russia dealt with joint meetings and general\n                statements on bilateral cooperation, 22% dealt with oppression of Crimean Tatars and human rights issue,\n                18% dealt with accusations for targeting non-DAESH groups, 16% dealt with framing opponent as the threat\n                for stability and security, 7% dealt with responsibility for deteriorating relations with Turkey and 8%\n                dealt with other related topics.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199304352\">The results presented in this section suggest that during the second time\n                interval, in contrast to Russian framing of Turkey, Turkey\u2019s tweets referencing Russia focused more on\n                meetings and statements on bilateral cooperation. One possible explanation for this might be that the\n                Turkish Government was making efforts to use diplomatic and military channels to restore relations with\n                Russia during the given period.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199303472\">This research focused on the manner in which both civil servants and government\n                institutions use Twitter to frame foreign governments. Given the desire to understand how nations frame\n                one another, it was decided to examine a dyad of countries. The research corpus included all tweets in\n                which one country in the dyad referred to the other during two time intervals encompassing more than 10\n                months and separated by serious political event \u2014 the downing of the Russian Su-24 by Turkey. A total of\n                262 tweets were analyzed using a codebook constructed specifically for the purpose of this research.\n                This codebook was used to examine the manner in which a dyad of nations frames one another as well as to\n                develop a methodology for analyzing frames at the level of the individual tweet.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199872704\">What characterized the Russia\u2013Turkey dyad was that the manner in which both\n                nations referred to one another altered between the two time intervals. During the first time interval,\n                both nations chose to illustrate their cooperation over the situation in Syria, highlighting common\n                efforts against IS and trade relations. During the second time interval, both nations framed one another\n                as responsible for escalating the situation in Syria and causing damage to bilateral relations. This was\n                made evident by an increase in the amount of tweets published by both nations that reached the 0.5\n                threshold on the Entman scale and the 0.5 threshold on the generic frames scales (see <a href=\"#F3\">Figure\n                    3<\/a>\u2013<a href=\"#F6\">Figure 6<\/a>). An explanation for this finding could lie in the fact that during\n                the second time interval, both nations found themselves engulfed in conflict in which each country in\n                the dyad attempted to offer its own interpretation to the events in Ukraine by defining the cause of the\n                conflict, passing moral judgments and offering solutions to the crisis.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199302512\">The most prevalent generic frame used by Russia to frame Turkey during both time\n                intervals was the conflict frame. This was also the most prevalent frame used by Turkey. This finding\n                suggests that both nations framed one another as military adversaries. More importantly, when using this\n                frame, both nations publicized their disagreements on a wide range of issues and not solely on the\n                escalating conflict in Syria.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199301632\">The second most prevalent frame used by the two nations during both time\n                intervals was the attribution of responsibility frame. This finding indicates that both nations used\n                Twitter to frame the other as responsible for the rising tensions between Russia and Turkey and for the\n                crisis in Syria, thereby justifying their own actions. This assertion is strengthened by the finding\n                that among the five generic frames, the one containing the highest proportion of tweets reaching the\n                threshold of 0.5 was the attribution of responsibility frame. This study also found that both nations\n                frequently used the morality frame. The third most prevalent frame used by both Russia and Turkey was\n                the morality frame. This finding indicates that framing might indeed be viewed as an attempt to damage\n                the adversary\u2019s reputation by calling into question his morality.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199300320\">Such framing may also be viewed as an attempt by one nation to tarnish the image\n                of another. By framing Russia as a menace to global peace, Turkey was promoting a specific image of\n                Russia to foreign audiences. This in turn may have infringed on Russia\u2019s own attempt to manage its\n                global image. Thus, social media may be regarded as a tool that enables one to restrain a foreign\n                country\u2019s soft power resources. By tarnishing a foreign country\u2019s image, nations can undermine each\n                other\u2019s public diplomatic activities.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199869136\">The fourth generic used by both parties was the human interest frame. Russian\n                tweets pointed at Turkey fighting Syrian Kurds, Turkish media censorship and the state of democracy,\n                whereas Turkish tweets meanwhile referred to Russia as responsible for the oppression of Crimean Tatars\n                and suggested human rights violations. It is reasonable to infer that both countries may have been\n                attempting to frame the other as morally bankrupt.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199868240\">Finally, the economic consequence frame was the least used frame of the five.\n                Russia used this frame when commenting on Russian sanctions imposed on Turkey, following the downing of\n                the Russian Su-24. No Turkish tweets mentioning Russia scored 0.5 or higher on the economic consequence\n                frame during the first time interval. This altered during the second time interval when Turkey referred\n                to this frame when Turkish Government called for economic cooperation with Russia instead of\n                embargoes.<\/p>\n\n            <p id=\"idm139973199867280\">Conducting analysis on both English and Russian language tweets allowed the\n                researcher to assess whether the framing of a country differs with regard to the target audience.\n                Analysis showed that Russian framing of Turkey was the same on its Russian language Twitter channel.\n                Russia and Turkey entered the field, Syria, with shared goals and dispositions to liquidate ISIL in the\n                territory of Syria. Their practice of involvement in the Syrian crisis was shaped from the past that\n                characterized relations between the two nations as important trade and economic partners and their\n                common vision on security issues, in particular, the war against ISIL. Yet following the downing of the\n                Russian Su-24, this \u201choneymoon\u201d period in bilateral relations ended completely, and diplomatic relations\n                between the two nations dipped to a critical point leading to social and economic transformations in the\n                wider Eurasian region. From Bourdieusian practice theory logic, in the given situation, a practice\n                change in bilateral relations might result from a shift in the objective structure of the field (Syrian\n                region) and\/or outdated dispositions of one of the actors involved in the conflict. Yet each social\n                dealing following the outbreak of conflict between the two nation \u2014 the downing the Russian pilot and\n                the subsequent reluctance of Turkish authorities\u2019 to convey apologies over the incident and so forth \u2014\n                had the potential to change the meaning of the past. Accordingly, this led to the change in practices.\n                Our analysis in this subsection provides empirical support for the arguments that highlight the\n                instability of practice.<\/p><\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139973199866320\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a>\n\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Conclusion<\/h3>\n\n        <p id=\"idm139973204174784\">In summary, digital diplomacy does indeed contain symbolic violence vis-\u00e0-vis other\n            diplomatic actors. When an actor, involved in digital diplomacy, issues a symbolic violence on his\n            adversary, he aims to hurt his adversary\u2019s dignity, honour and reputation through the use of posts and\n            comments, containing insults, intimidation, disrespect and deliberate non-observance of diplomatic tact. To\n            achieve this, social media platforms, which are increasingly popular among diplomatic actors, proved to be a\n            potent instrument. As of today, diplomatic actors keep on exploiting not only institutional accounts but\n            also their individual working accounts<sup id=\"xref31\"><a href=\"#fn31\">31<\/a><\/sup> to damage the\n            international status and reputation of their adversaries.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm139973204172880\">This study aimed to examine whether it was possible to establish how a change in\n            practice (in the example of Russia\u2013Turkey relations before and after the downing of the Russian Su-24)\n            originates utilising an alternative practice \u2013 theoretical toolkit \u2013contradictory framing of the past. To\n            achieve this, we have examined what potentially might cause a change in practice in the Russia\u2013Turkish case\n            and to what extent the potential of social media can be harnessed by governments to shape public opinion and\n            influence diplomatic actors\u2019 international reputation. As the proposed theoretical toolkit of contradictory\n            framing of the past assumed parties involved in the conflict perceived the situation with the downing of a\n            Russian pilot at an individual level, the same incident has been framed differently by each of them on\n            social networking sites. To develop each social action from the outbreak of conflict between the two nations\n            \u2014 the downing of the Russian pilot and the reluctance of the Turkish authorities\u2019 to convey apologies and so\n            forth \u2014 had the potential to change the meaning of the past and therefore the interpretation of the present.\n            This eventually led to the change in practices.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm139973199863504\">The exercise of invisible power by Russia and Turkey with one another\u2019s complicity\n            takes the form of routine symbolic violence. Both Russia and Turkey attempted to narrate each other\u2019s\n            behaviour through framing one another on Twitter focusing on the legitimacy and morality of each other\u2019s\n            policies. In that sense, it can be viewed as an act of imposing violence as it aims to limit the opponent\u2019s\n            ability to carry out the latter\u2019s foreign political prerogatives. Moreover, as the twitter analysis of the\n            Russian and Turkish framing of one another showed that governments can and do harness the potential of using\n            images and words as the weapons of symbolic violence when they attempt to impose their own narration on a\n            given event or situation.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm139973199862288\">To continue, the two nations in our analysis tried to display perceived reality to\n            twitter followers in accordance with their own ideological orientations. Through framing and narration,\n            Russia and Turkey continued to use Twitter as an arena for ideological struggles in which each nation\n            promotes its own truth. Consequently, the true power struggles between nations might be hidden from the\n            public. Twitter followers may view a Russian tweet about fighting Syrian Kurds by Turkey as a fact rather\n            than one element of a larger picture aimed at discrediting the other side. Turkish twitter followers, for\n            instance, may fail to view information tweeted by the Turkish Government bodies and institutions as part of\n            ideological narration. The lack of structural common knowledge and the existence of conflicting positions\n            resulted in routine acts of symbolic violence, utilising digital technologies.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm139973199860928\">As far as the limitations of this research is concerned, due to the relatively recent\n            experience of applying framing tools to social media in international communications field, the majority of\n            tweets examined in this paper did not meet all elements of Entman\u2019s definition of frames and all elements of\n            generic frames. Thus, the results of this research offer only a partial answer to our research questions and\n            warrants further investigation.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm139973199860016\">To develop our interpretation of change that results from contradictory framing of\n            the past by parties involved in the conflict cannot claim to be a comprehensive theory of how international\n            practices change: we can speak about other alternative mechanisms to ones we have proposed. Given the lack\n            of clear articulations of change by practice theorists, in this paper, we attempted to elaborate a mechanism\n            of change in international practices in the context of Russian and Turkish relations before and after the\n            downing of the Russian pilot of Su-24.<\/p>\n\n        <p id=\"idm139973199859008\">Studying the role of symbolic violence in the context of social media diplomacy has\n            indicated that digital communication technologies have in recent years been used as powerful weapons in\n            international affairs. Governments are becoming increasingly aware of social media\u2019s huge potential as a\n            means of immediate and direct communication with an international community. Social media possess the\n            potential to impact on public perception of reality and the ability to focus on international attention to a\n            given country with great immediacy. Apart from this, social media acts as a platform for political and civil\n            discourse where the symbols and their underlying meaning can be discussed. It has the potential to connect\n            people in a way that they have never been connected before.<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"article-back\" class=\"back\">\n    <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139973199857120\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a>\n\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Declaration of interest<\/h3>\n\n        <p id=\"idm139973199856128\">Sherzod Arapov declares that he has no conflict of interest.<\/p><\/div>\n    <h3 class=\"main-title\">Funding sources<\/h3>\n\n    <p>None.<\/p>\n\n    <h3 class=\"main-title\">Supporting material<\/h3>\n\n    <div><p><strong>S1.

Currently, the economic viability of such systems is limited by fuel cell short lifetime due to a progressive performance degradation that leads to cell failure. Mitigating these phenomena would have a significant impact on system economic feasibility. In this study, the lifetime of a standalone, atmospheric SOFC system was compared to a pressurized SOFC gas turbine hybrid and an economic analysis was performed. In both cases, the power production was required to be constant over time, with significantly different results for the two systems in terms of fuel cell operating life, system efficiency, and economic return. In the hybrid system, an extended fuel cell lifetime is achieved while maintaining high system efficiency and improving economic performance. In this work, the optimal power density was determined for the standalone fuel cell in order to have the best economic performance. Nevertheless, the hybrid system showed better economic performance, and it was less affected by the stack cost.<\/p><\/div>\n",

In particular, efficiency on coal syngas could be competitive with combined cycles,\n            and, especially for small size plants, this type of system promises the highest conversion efficiencies (<a href=\"#fn06\" id=\"xref06\">Massardo et al., 2002<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"xref12\">Song et al., 2006<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"xref10\">Park et al., 2011<\/a>),\n            which translates to reduced emissions and noteworthy economic benefits.<\/p>\n        <p id=\"idm140017769532288\">Compared to a standalone fuel cell, hybridization with a gas turbine introduces additional opportunities. Gas turbine capability for quick load following can improve system flexibility (<a href=\"#fn07\" id=\"xref07\">Mueller et al., 2008<\/a>;\n            <a\n                href=\"#fn02\" id=\"xref02\">Barelli et al., 2013<\/a>); furthermore, degradation phenomena in the fuel cell can be mitigated by shifting the power production from the fuel cell to the turbine (<a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"xref13\">Tucker et al., 2014<\/a>).<\/p>\n        <p id=\"idm140017769611328\">Useful lifetime in SOFCs is currently limited by several mechanisms that degrade fuel cell performance over time and bring the cell to failure (<a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"xref15\">Yokokawa et al., 2008<\/a>). Those phenomena are related to presence of\n            impurities in the fuel, temperature fluctuations, high operating current density or high fuel utilization (FU) (<a href=\"#fn04\" id=\"xref04\">Haga et al., 2008<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn09\" id=\"xref09\">Offer and Brandon, 2009<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn08\" id=\"xref08\">Nakajo et al., 2012<\/a>).\n            The necessity of replacing the fuel cell stack every few years in a power plant is a major limitation for such a technology, since the cost of the stack is currently in the order of 2\u20133 k$\/kW (<a href=\"#fn03\" id=\"xref03\">Colantoni et al., 2011<\/a>).\n            More sophisticated materials that could reduce degradation would also increase the cost even further.<\/p>\n        <p id=\"idm140017766963120\">In a hybrid system, operating strategies exist to extend fuel cell useful lifetime (<a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"xref13\">Tucker et al., 2014<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"xref18\">Zaccaria et al., 2017<\/a>), which would have a great impact on system economic\n            feasibility. The flexibility and reliability introduced by the gas turbine could potentially accelerate SOFCs market penetration. The purpose of this work is to assess the economic benefits of fuel cell gas turbine hybridization, including\n            the impact on fuel cell life time.<\/p>\n        <p id=\"idm140017766805264\">This study was conducted to compare a standalone SOFC stack and a hybrid system over a period of 20 years, assuming a constant power production. The same assumptions were used for both systems, to evaluate the relative difference in terms of economic\n            parameters such as Payback Period (PBP) and Net Present Value (NPV). This analysis showed how the PBP can be halved and NPV can be doubled in a hybrid system thanks to the synergistic integration of SOFC and gas turbine.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"section\">\n        <a id=\"idm140017766799120\">\n            <!-- named anchor -->\n        <\/a>\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Hybrid system description<\/h3>\n        <p id=\"idm140017766789168\">The configuration of a generic gas turbine fuel cell hybrid system is illustrated in <a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1<\/a>: for sake of simplicity, such layout omits many details necessary for plant control and\/or fuel pre-processing.

Since for this preliminary work, the gas turbine was a map-driven model, detailed thermo-and fluid-dynamics information were not considered, which\n            could impact on turbomachinery or heat exchanger lifetime. This level of details could be included in a future work for more accurate analysis.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"section\">\n        <a id=\"idm140017769356960\">\n            <!-- named anchor -->\n        <\/a>\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Methodology<\/h3>\n        <div class=\"section\">\n            <a id=\"idm140017769356160\">\n                <!-- named anchor -->\n            <\/a>\n            <h4 class=\"section-title\">Operating strategy<\/h4>\n            <p id=\"idm140017769355360\">For this study, the system was assumed to produce a constant base load for 8,760 h per year, without considering startup and shut down that would accelerate fuel cell degradation. Part-load operations were not considered here for simplicity.\n                A control strategy was implemented for the standalone SOFC stack and the hybrid system to maintain constant power production over time while the fuel cell was degrading (<a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"xref18\">Zaccaria et al., 2017<\/a>). In the standalone\n                SOFC, the current was increased over time to compensate for voltage decay and the FU was kept constant by increasing the fuel flow accordingly. As the current increased, cathode airflow was incremented to control the temperature difference\n                between cathode inlet and outlet and reduce thermal stresses in the electrolyte. This was assumed to be carried out by a blower consuming 10% of nominal SOFC power. Plant end of life was defined as the voltage dropped to zero.<\/p>\n            <p id=\"idm140017769352928\">The gas turbine of the hybrid system introduced one more degree of freedom, because total system power could be maintained by modulating turbine load. The size of the stack and the turbine was assumed the same, and the stack started with producing\n                100% of its nominal power while the turbine worked at around 40% of design power. No action was performed to keep constant SOFC power, in contrast, the load on the turbine was incremented over time to meet the power demand of 480 kW from\n                the system. This could have been done either by injecting auxiliary fuel into the OGB downstream the stack or by increasing the fuel flow on the anode side of the fuel cell: the latter option was chosen, as efficiency is positively impacted.\n                Moreover, such operation had the benefit of lowering the FU, improving Nernst potential, and reducing some of the degradation mechanisms in the cell. The cell current was decreased to keep constant voltage and let power degrade. This strategy\n                was proved to potentially extend fuel cell lifetime (<a href=\"#fn08\" id=\"xref08\">Nakajo et al., 2012<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"xref16\">Zaccaria et al., 2016a<\/a>). Plant end of life was defined as fuel cell power decreased to 30% of nominal\n                power.<\/p>\n            <p id=\"idm140017769349296\">For thermal management of the SOFC, cathode airflow had to be reduced in this case. A bypass valve (not reported in <a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1<\/a>) was modeled using an empirical transfer function found in a previous work (<a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"xref17\">Zaccaria et al., 2016b<\/a>).\n                Since the turbine speed was considered constant in this work, the bypass valve was used to regulate cathode airflow. The bypass diverted airflow from compressor discharge to turbine inlet, reducing cathode airflow, turbine inlet temperature,\n                exhaust gas temperature, and cathode inlet temperature (<a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"xref17\">Zaccaria et al., 2016b<\/a>). The effect on pressure drop change was not analyzed in this work.<\/p>\n            <p id=\"idm140017769720160\">Summarizing, in the hybrid system more flexible operations were possible providing the following advantages compared to the standalone SOFC:<\/p>\n            <div class=\"list\">\n                <a id=\"idm140017769719552\">\n                    <!-- named anchor -->\n                <\/a>\n                <ul>\n                    <li>\n                        <p id=\"idm140017769718768\">Cell current could be reduced, decreasing degradation and keeping constant voltage;<\/p>\n                    <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                        <p id=\"idm140017769718160\">SOFC power was not required to be constant because extra power could be generated by the gas turbine;<\/p>\n                    <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                        <p id=\"idm140017769717440\">Fuel cell thermal management did not require additional energy consumption because cathode airflow was provided by the compressor and not by a separate blower; in addition, regulating airflow with the bypass valve was beneficial\n                            to decrease exhaust gas temperature, which tended to increase as the load on the turbine increased;<\/p>\n                    <\/li>\n                    <li>\n                        <p id=\"idm140017769716480\">System efficiency was higher, which was expected to have a positive effect on economic results.<\/p>\n                    <\/li>\n                <\/ul>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n        <div class=\"section\">\n            <a id=\"idm140017769715600\">\n                <!-- named anchor -->\n            <\/a>\n            <h4 class=\"section-title\">Test conditions<\/h4>\n            <p id=\"idm140017769714800\">The initial conditions for the simulations are presented in <a href=\"#T1\"><span class=\"generated\">Table 1<\/span><\/a> . The size of the systems was chosen based on SOFC state of the art, considering distributed generation applications. For\n                a consistent comparison, a case was considered where initial current density and FU were the same in the standalone stack and in the hybrid system. However, for completeness, other four cases were investigated for the standalone fuel cell\n                at lower current densities. The purpose was to find an economic optimum for the standalone system and compare hybrid system performance with both cases: same initial conditions scenario and best case scenario for the standalone configuration.\n                Initial cathode airflow value was changed in these five cases to keep the same initial temperature increase of 100\u00b0C across the cell.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"container-fluid table-container\">\n                <div class=\"row\">\n                    <div class=\"col-sm-8\">\n                        <div class=\"img-table-footer row\">\n                            <p class=\"fig-title\">Table 1 - Initial conditions.<\/p>\n                        <\/div>\n                    <\/div>\n                    <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                        <div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-right\"><a href=\"#T1\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span>Enlarge Table\n                        <\/a><br\/><\/div>\n                    <\/div>\n                <\/div>\n                <div class=\"row inline-content\" id=\"article-table\">\n                    <div class=\"table-overflow\">\n                        <table class=\"table table-hover\" id=\"T1\">\n                            <col width=\"*\" \/>\n                            <col width=\"*\" \/>\n                            <col width=\"*\" \/>\n                            <thead>\n                                <tr>\n                                    <th align=\"left\" \/>\n                                    <th align=\"center\">Standalone SOFC<\/th>\n                                    <th align=\"center\">Hybrid system<\/th>\n                                <\/tr>\n                            <\/thead>\n                            <tbody>\n                                <tr>\n                                    <td align=\"left\">Current density [A\/cm<sup>2<\/sup>]<\/td>\n                                    <td align=\"center\">0.1\u20130.5<\/td>\n                                    <td align=\"center\">0.5<\/td>\n                                <\/tr>\n                                <tr>\n                                    <td align=\"left\">Cell voltage [V]<\/td>\n                                    <td align=\"center\">0.78\u20130.83<\/td>\n                                    <td align=\"center\">0.82<\/td>\n                                <\/tr>\n                                <tr>\n                                    <td align=\"left\">Stack power [kW]<\/td>\n                                    <td align=\"center\">71\u2013330<\/td>\n                                    <td align=\"center\">330<\/td>\n                                <\/tr>\n                                <tr>\n                                    <td align=\"left\">Cathode airflow [kg\/s]<\/td>\n                                    <td align=\"center\">0.7\u20131.0<\/td>\n                                    <td align=\"center\">1.0<\/td>\n                                <\/tr>\n                                <tr>\n                                    <td align=\"left\">Cathode inlet temperature [\u00b0C]<\/td>\n                                    <td align=\"center\">700<\/td>\n                                    <td align=\"center\">700<\/td>\n                                <\/tr>\n                                <tr>\n                                    <td align=\"left\">Fuel utilization<\/td>\n                                    <td align=\"center\">0.8<\/td>\n                                    <td align=\"center\">0.8<\/td>\n                                <\/tr>\n                                <tr>\n                                    <td align=\"left\">Pressure ratio<\/td>\n                                    <td align=\"center\">1<\/td>\n                                    <td align=\"center\">3.5<\/td>\n                                <\/tr>\n                                <tr>\n                                    <td align=\"left\">Turbine power [kW]<\/td>\n                                    <td align=\"center\">\u2014<\/td>\n                                    <td align=\"left\">150 (out of 350 kW design power)<\/td>\n                                <\/tr>\n                                <tr>\n                                    <td align=\"left\">Turbine inlet temperature [\u00b0C]<\/td>\n                                    <td align=\"center\">\u2014<\/td>\n                                    <td align=\"center\">1,150<\/td>\n                                <\/tr>\n                            <\/tbody>\n                        <\/table>\n                    <\/div>\n                <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <p id=\"idm140017769712352\">A summary of the control strategies for the two systems is shown in <a href=\"#T2\"><span class=\"generated\">Table 2<\/span><\/a> .

In particular, for the standalone stack, the end of life meant the failure of the stack (when the voltage dropped to zero). In the hybrid system, the\n            stack was replaced when the turbine reached design power condition, because total system power could not be maintained constant after that point unless increasing SOFC power.<\/p>\n        <p id=\"idm140017769767712\">The economic benefit was evaluated in terms of PBP, NPV at 20 years, and Internal Rate of Return (IRR), calculated according to <a href=\"#E15\"><span class=\"generated\">Equation 15<\/span><\/a> \u2013 <a href=\"#E18\"><span class=\"generated\">Equation 18<\/span><\/a>            .

The initial current density was varied from 0.5 to 0.1 A\/cm<sup>2<\/sup>. Consequently, the nominal power was varied from 330 to 71 kW. The\n        stack size was assumed the same, with a design capability of 330 kW, with the advantage of extending the life of the fuel cell and reducing the number of replacements when the power density is kept lower. Obviously, there was expected to be a\n        trade-off between sold electricity and fuel cell lifetime. FU was kept 80% in all the case studies. <a href=\"#F3\">Figure 3<\/a> presents stack power over time in the five cases.<\/p>\n    <div class=\"container-fluid img-container\">\n        <div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F3\" \/>\n            <div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/8037ac34-563e-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/dolorem_debitis_illum_400.png\" \/><\/div>\n            <div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/8037ac34-563e-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/dolorem_debitis_illum_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/8037ac34-563e-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JGPPS-00008-2017-01_F0003.tif\" download=\"JGPPS-00008-2017-01_F0003.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n        <div class=\"row\">\n            <p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 3 - Stack power over time for the standalone fuel cell at different initial current densities.<\/p>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <p id=\"idm140017767360880\">As shown in <a href=\"#F3\">Figure 3<\/a>, the benefit of decreasing the power density in terms of fuel cell lifetime was substantial.

For example, in the case with lowest current density,\n        the stack should be replaced once every 11 years. Hence, the cost of the stack would have a great impact in determining the most beneficial strategy.<\/p>\n    <p id=\"idm140017767356944\">With a stack cost of 132,000 $, the case at highest current density was not economically feasible, since the cashflows were negative throughout the system lifetime. <a href=\"#T4\"><span class=\"generated\">Table 4<\/span><\/a> shows PBP, NPV, and IRR,\n        where the case at 0.2 A\/cm<sup>2<\/sup> appeared to be the most economically advantageous.

The integration of these two different technologies favored\n        a high system efficiency over time despite fuel cell performance degradation. The flexibility added by the gas turbine allowed an operating strategy that extended fuel cell lifetime and improved system performance. The economic results showed\n        that the PBP for the hybrid system was half and NPV doubled compared to the SOFC best-case scenario, while the IRR increased by 54%.<\/p>\n    <p id=\"idm140017769334960\">In the standalone SOFC system, operating life could be extended oversizing the stack at constant power demand, which made economic results extremely dependent on stack cost. An optimal value for operating current density was found around 0.2 A\/cm<sup>2<\/sup>.\n        In contrast, in a hybrid system, part of the power could be produced by the most reliable component, varying the power share between fuel cell and turbine as the first one degraded. This fortunate integration doubled SOFC lifetime compared to\n        the standalone best case and significantly improved economic results with no substantial dependence on the stack cost. Hence, hybridization with a gas turbine could facilitate early market penetration of SOFCs, at current costs and performance\n        degradation rates. As such, the higher initial capital investment would be compensated by higher efficiency and less frequent replacements of the stack.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n    <a

Life underground has advantages (protection against predators, environmental control and reduced competition) but also implies disadvantages (digging costs, coping with hypercapnia, physiological and sensory changes, and communication problems) that can affect the social structure. Reproduction is a critical moment in the use of the signal repertoire, because individuals should locate in space, travel to, contact and copulate with a suitable partner. Energy expenditure involved in digging (connecting) tunnels makes difficult to attain a partner burrow system, but predation risk involved in moving above ground can counterbalance it and coupled with the spatial structure of the population, can determine the best communicative strategy to contact and locate a potential partner. Vocalisations allow to communicate over longer distances an with a reduced risk, while chemical signals, mostly aimed at vomerolfaction involve proximity or direct contact with the sample odour thus making information gathering more risky. As <i>Ctenomys<\/i> can use different signal types to gather different types of information leading to copulation, we propose that the use of these signals would be flexible, depending mostly on population spatial structure and type of predators living in the zone. This is because differences among species and\/or populations in the use and characteristics of long-range vocalisations could be induced by environmental and\/or social factors. This variation could be considered as a case of phenotypic plasticity, determining communication strategies variability in reproductive context, mostly dependent on long-range communication signals and the behaviour of males.<\/p><\/div>\n",

The genus appeared in the late Pliocene and rapidly diversified towards the species identified in the present, that can be associated to at least 8 different groups in their yet unresolved phylogeny (<a href=\"#fn38\" id=\"xref38\">Parada et al., 2011<\/a>). While they are extremely variable at the genetic level, and capable of living from sea level up to 4,000\u00a0m in the Andes, and from grasslands to xeric habitats, they apparently maintain the majority of their general characteristics of behaviour, morphology, and physiological adaptations (<a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"xref21\">Francescoli, 2000<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"xref25\">Francescoli et al., 2004<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997502944\">The genus <i>Ctenomys<\/i> has more than 55 nominated species, highly variable in some characteristics, but very similar in other characteristics. This high number of species probably had their origin in factors like their subterranean lifestyle, patchy distribution, limited vagility, high territoriality, low effective number, great karyotypic variability and the characteristics of their mating system (<a href=\"#fn41\" id=\"xref41\">Reig et al., 1990<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn37\" id=\"xref37\">Nevo, 1999<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"xref25\">Francescoli et al., 2004<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997096080\">These animals spend almost all their life inside burrows, thus they are considered truly subterranean animals (<a href=\"#fn32\" id=\"xref32\">Lacey et al., 2000<\/a>), but differently from other subterranean rodents they leave their burrows to forage -cutting grasses and plants- above ground and usually hoarding them or consuming them inside their tunnels. This above ground activity means that juveniles are exposed to predation when foraging and when dispersing above ground (but not all species have juveniles dispersing that way), and adults are mostly exposed when foraging outside their tunnels (<a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"xref10\">Busch et al., 2000<\/a>). Many reports have identified their main predators as: aerial raptors (<a href=\"#fn47\" id=\"xref47\">Weir, 1974<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn45\" id=\"xref45\">Vassallo et al., 1994<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"xref10\">Busch et al., 2000<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn30\" id=\"xref30\">Kittlein et al., 2001<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"xref3\">Altuna and Gonzalez, 2006<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"xref8\">Baladr\u00f3n et al., 2009<\/a>), terrestrial mammals as foxes, skunks and grisons (<a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"xref10\">Busch et al., 2000<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn33\" id=\"xref33\">Lacey and Sherman, 2007<\/a>); Francescoli, unpublished data), and snakes (<a href=\"#fn42\" id=\"xref42\">Rosi et al., 2003<\/a>). Indeed, it has been established that up to an 18% of the prey species captured by owls are <i>Ctenomys<\/i> individuals from various species (<a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"xref10\">Busch et al., 2000<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997102768\">Even if some species have been identified as social, with females living in small groups and male floaters associated to the groups (<a href=\"#fn31\" id=\"xref31\">Lacey and Ebensperger, 2007<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"xref26\">Francescoli et al., 2016<\/a>), the majority of the species known until now are solitary. In solitary species, each individual occupies its own burrow system and aggressively defends it, exception made of juveniles living with their mothers before dispersing. Also, in many solitary species burrow systems are usually not interconnected (<i>e.g.<\/i>, <i>C.\u00a0pearsoni<\/i>; <i>C. talarum<\/i>), but during the mating season male and female burrows are usually connected for a brief period to allow courtship and copulation to occur. After the end of the mating activities, connecting tunnels are sealed off (<a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"xref2\">Altuna et al., 1999<\/a>). In other solitary species (<i>e.g.<\/i>, <i>C. talarum<\/i>), as a laboratory study using artificial tunnel systems show, individuals get together to copulate as one of the members of the couple (frequently the male) reach the burrow system of the other by travelling above ground (<a href=\"#fn51\" id=\"xref51\">Zenuto et al., 2002<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997130352\">Underground living has some advantages: protection from predators, food availability (depending on the ecosystem), control of external variables like temperature and humidity, and reduced competition. Nevertheless, it has some disadvantages that lead these animals to adapt to particular conditions like digging costs, hypercapnia, water management, or sensory and communication challenges (<a href=\"#fn41\" id=\"xref41\">Reig et al., 1990<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"xref21\">Francescoli, 2000<\/a>). About the last mentioned feature, living in dark burrows prevents the use of vision for communication, so tuco-tucos have developed mainly tactile, chemical and acoustic signals to communicate with conspecifics either inside or between burrow systems. This last characteristic is especially important in solitary species, in which communicating with a putative mate to allow encounter, courtship and copulation is vital to the species survival.<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997145280\">Tuco-tucos do not have reduced eyes as other strictly subterranean genus, but visual communication is almost impossible inside tunnels that are completely dark. Nevertheless, there are some indications that tuco-tucos can be sensible to UV light and eventually follow urine marks using UV vision (<a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"xref26\">Francescoli et al., 2016<\/a>). As a consequence, these animals mostly use acoustic, chemical or tactile signals to communicate with their neighbours (competitors) and\/or sexual partners.<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997152832\">Due to their characteristics, tactile and chemical signals are mostly bounded to an inside burrow use. As have been shown for <i>C. talarum<\/i> chemical signals are important once the male has entered the female tunnel (<a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"xref18\">Fanjul et al., 2003<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"xref15\">Fanjul and Zenuto, 2008a<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn50\" id=\"xref50\">Zenuto et al., 2004<\/a>, <a href=\"#fn48\" id=\"xref48\">2007<\/a>). Urine allow animals to detect the reproductive condition of a conspecific of different sex. During courtship male and female can sniff each other\u2019s genital areas, gathering more information. Chemical signals could also be important in case of accidental invasion of another individual\u2019s tunnel system. Chemical social signals seem to be mostly directed to the vomerolfactive system, thus constraining these animals to close contact sampling of the chemicals for identification, and then making difficult their use as a long-distance (inter-burrow) communication system (see <a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"xref17\">Fanjul and Zenuto, 2017<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997139120\">Tactile signals, mostly based on biting, grasping, licking, and whisker contact, are very important during courtship, mounting and copulation (<a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"xref1\">Altuna et al., 1991<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"xref16\">Fanjul and Zenuto, 2008b<\/a>). During the very act of copulation males could also transmit tactile information to females because male\u2019s penis is armed with spines and spikes (<a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"xref4\">Altuna and Lessa, 1985<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"xref14\">Dewsbury, 1988<\/a>). As tuco-tucos are induced ovulators this tactile information is very important for successful reproduction because it is thought to trigger ovulation when sperm is present, thus insuring insemination (<a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"xref9\">Bennett et al., 2000<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"xref25\">Francescoli et al., 2004<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997092576\">Seismic signals have been mentioned as responsible for long-range communication in other subterranean rodents (<a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"xref21\">Francescoli, 2000<\/a>) but they have not been detected in tuco-tucos.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139707997111024\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Why tuco-tuco\u2019s vocalisations are important?<\/h3><p id=\"idm139707997115632\">Acoustic signals seem to play the main role in <i>Ctenomys<\/i> communication systems, and some studies explored their repertoires from both the physical and functional perspectives (<a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"xref20\">Francescoli, 1999<\/a>, <a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"xref22\">2001<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn43\" id=\"xref43\">Schleich and Busch, 2002<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"xref27\">Francescoli and Quirici, 2010<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"xref6\">Amaya et al., 2016<\/a>). Vocal signals have a widespread usage by tuco-tucos, both in long- and short-range communicative situations (<a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"xref20\">Francescoli, 1999<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn43\" id=\"xref43\">Schleich and Busch, 2002<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"xref27\">Francescoli and Quirici, 2010<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"xref6\">Amaya et al., 2016<\/a>). Short-range vocalisations, are mostly related to proximity courtship and copulation (these having higher main frequencies than the long-range ones), and also with intra-tunnel aggression (these also having low main frequencies) as shown by <a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"xref20\">Francescoli (1999)<\/a> and <a href=\"#fn43\" id=\"xref43\">Schleich and Busch (2002)<\/a>.<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997038752\">It is generally thought that vocal signals are a poor way for long-range communication in subterranean animals, but tuco-tucos seem to be the exception to this \u201crule.\u201d These signals are used as territorial advertising and, as suggested by field data on <i>C. pearsoni<\/i> (<a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"xref24\">Francescoli, 2011<\/a>) and by some field but mostly laboratory data in <i>Ctenomys<\/i> sp. \u201cAnillaco\u201d (<a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"xref6\">Amaya et al., 2016<\/a>), could encode information about location, sex and reproductive disposition of the emitter.<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997142048\">Many species of tuco-tucos are known to vocalise loud enough to be heard at a considerable distance outside their burrows (<a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"xref21\">Francescoli, 2000<\/a>, <a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"xref24\">2011<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn43\" id=\"xref43\">Schleich and Busch, 2002<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"xref6\">Amaya et al., 2016<\/a>); these long-range vocalisations could be used as territorial signals (<a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"xref20\">Francescoli, 1999<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn43\" id=\"xref43\">Schleich and Busch, 2002<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"xref6\">Amaya et al., 2016<\/a>) and also inform about some sexual and reproductive characteristics of the emitter (<a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"xref24\">Francescoli, 2011<\/a>). In the majority of the species sampled, exception made of <i>Ctenomys sociabilis<\/i>, long-range vocalisations have their main frequencies in a band going from 180 to 300\u00a0Hz (<a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"xref20\">Francescoli, 1999<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn43\" id=\"xref43\">Schleich and Busch, 2002<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"xref27\">Francescoli and Quirici, 2010<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"xref6\">Amaya et al., 2016<\/a>) and the frequency range of their emissions is in the audible part of the sound spectrum, with no ultrasound or infrasound use yet detected.<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997126992\">Available information shows that at least <i>C. flamarioni<\/i> (K. Sach\u00e9 pers. comm.), <i>C. haigi<\/i> (<a href=\"#fn40\" id=\"xref40\">Pearson and Christie, 1985<\/a>), <i>C. mendocinus<\/i> (<a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"xref27\">Francescoli and Quirici, 2010<\/a>), <i>C. pearsoni<\/i> (<a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"xref20\">Francescoli, 1999<\/a>), <i>C.\u00a0peruanus<\/i> (<a href=\"#fn39\" id=\"xref39\">Pearson, 1959<\/a>), <i>C. rionegrensis<\/i> (<a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"xref27\">Francescoli and Quirici, 2010<\/a>), <i>C. sociabilis<\/i> (<a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"xref27\">Francescoli and Quirici, 2010<\/a>), <i>Ctenomys sp.<\/i> \u201cAnillaco\u201d (<a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"xref6\">Amaya et al., 2016<\/a>), <i>C. talarum<\/i> (<a href=\"#fn43\" id=\"xref43\">Schleich and Busch, 2002<\/a>), and <i>C. torquatus<\/i> (<a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"xref27\">Francescoli and Quirici, 2010<\/a>) use long-range vocalisations which are mainly low frequency, repetitive, rhythmic signals.<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997047024\">Some studies suggest that using low-frequency rhythmic signals could be a result of the constraints imposed by the underground environment and that propagation conditions determine rhythm-encoded information as more reliable than a frequency modulation-encoded one (<a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"xref20\">Francescoli, 1999<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"xref28\">Francescoli et al., 2012<\/a>). Other views (Francescoli, unpublished data) agree with the idea that the main force determining signal design in subterranean rodent vocalisations is motivation, because when we look at the signal\u2019s quality we can see that aggressive signals are mostly harsh sounds and mating signals tend to be tonal, in accordance with the frequency characteristics highlighted by <a href=\"#fn35\" id=\"xref35\">Morton (1977<\/a>, <a href=\"#fn36\" id=\"xref36\">1982)<\/a> to define his motivation-structural rules. Then, motivation seems to be the main force constraining signal design in subterranean rodents, but environmental constraints could be more influential in the long distance signals, maybe causing motivation-structural rules to have taken a secondary role in the design of these signals during evolution (<a href=\"#fn36\" id=\"xref36\">Morton, 1982<\/a>): 191\u2013192; Francescoli, unpublished data). Indeed, there are reports of differences among species and even between different populations of the same species, at the level of copulatory mechanisms (<a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"xref1\">Altuna et al., 1991<\/a>); <a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"xref16\">Fanjul and Zenuto, 2008b<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"xref11\">Cam\u00edn, 1999<\/a>), mate searching strategies (<a href=\"#fn50\" id=\"xref50\">Zenuto et al., 2004<\/a>, <a href=\"#fn48\" id=\"xref48\">2007<\/a>), and vocal signals (<a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"xref23\">Francescoli, 2002<\/a>, <a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"xref24\">2011<\/a>) thus, spatial organisation and environmental constraints could influence the ways tuco-tucos communicate and\/or their \u201cchoice\u201d of modalities to communicate during reproduction (<a href=\"#fn51\" id=\"xref51\">Zenuto et al., 2002<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"xref12\">Cutrera et al., 2006<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"xref20\">Francescoli, 1999<\/a>, <a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"xref24\">2011<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997352768\">Then, based on the personal work of the author and data published in the literature, the intention of this review is to establish associations among behavioural characteristics and environmental conditions during reproduction that may be responsible for modulating the use of long-range vocalisations by tuco-tucos.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139707997351824\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Different strategies for different ecological\/behavioral variables?<\/h3><p id=\"idm139707997351056\">Reproduction is a critical moment in the use of the signal repertoire. During the initial stages of reproduction solitary animals should use medium and long distance signals allowing them to locate and obtain some information about putative partners, to orientate when contacting the partner (then lowering the energy investment to reach at them), and to select the appropriate strategy to navigate towards the partner while evading predators.<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997350144\">In social tuco-tucos (like <i>Ctenomys sociabilis<\/i>) the grouped sex are females and males spend different periods with different female groups, fertilising them and then changing group. Communicating at long distances is not an imperative because they can find reproductive partners in the same or in neighbouring groups, and communal burrow systems are usually close to one another (<a href=\"#fn34\" id=\"xref34\">Lacey and Wieczorek, 2004<\/a>), probably acting as information centres for reproduction (<a href=\"#fn46\" id=\"xref46\">Ward and Zahavi, 1973<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn29\" id=\"xref29\">Galef and Wigmore, 1983<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997345600\">Conversely, solitary animals live each one in one burrow system and these systems could be distant from one another depending on population\u2019s density. They need to detect and find a suitable partner of the other sex, mainly using long range signals to obtain information about who are their neighbours and where are they located, while maintaining their territories (<a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"xref20\">Francescoli, 1999<\/a>, <a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"xref21\">2000<\/a>, <a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"xref24\">2011<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn43\" id=\"xref43\">Schleich and Busch, 2002<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997340400\">Thus, in solitary animals and especially during the mating season, energy expenditure involved in digging (to reach a putative partner\u2019s burrow system) can be counterbalanced by predation risk involved in moving above ground (to forage and\/or to attain a putative partner\u2019s burrow entrance), and coupled with the spatial structure of the population can determine the best strategy to contact a potential partner (<a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"xref21\">Francescoli, 2000<\/a>). This contact is made easier if animals can previously locate putative partners by means of long-range communication signals.<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997338320\">In view of what we know about tuco-tuco\u2019s communication, there are only two options for inter-burrow communication: a) scent marks, mostly aimed at vomerolfaction thus involving proximity or direct contact, must be deposited outside the burrow to allow location by the receiver, thus exposing both sender and receiver to predators; b) vocal signals, that are characteristic of these animals but could demand an important energetic investment (<a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"xref21\">Francescoli, 2000<\/a>, <a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"xref24\">2011<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997335232\">In <i>C. pearsoni<\/i>, long-range vocalisations, at a population level, peak twice a day at particular times during the day (<a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"xref24\">Francescoli, 2011<\/a>), while in <i>C. talarum<\/i> Mar de Cobo population male vocalisations were recorded during the crepuscular or nocturnal period (<a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"xref12\">Cutrera et al., 2006<\/a>). In <i>Ctenomys<\/i> sp. \u201cAnillaco\u201d animals are active mostly during the night in the laboratory, but they have been seen outside their burrows foraging at least once during the day in the field (<a href=\"#fn44\" id=\"xref44\">Tomotani et al., 2012<\/a>); long-range vocalisations were recorded in the laboratory during the night (mostly because of logistic reasons), but they appeared also during the day in the field (<a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"xref5\">Amaya, 2017<\/a>). This variability could be explained by several hypotheses suggested by <a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"xref24\">Francescoli (2011)<\/a>: vocalisation peaks exploit daily variations in surface environmental conditions enhancing sound propagation due to changes in soil temperature or humidity levels; they allow animals to gather information at more predictable moments; they facilitate location of neighbour movements; they avoid vocalising during periods when big terrestrial mammals (<i>i.e.<\/i>, cows, horses), are active and can interfere.<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997326640\">Vocal signals acting at long distances have some drawbacks because they are potential sources of Public Information (<a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"xref13\">Danchin et al., 2004<\/a>) that could originate eavesdropping opportunities by other individuals like conspecifics, competitors and\/or predators. Long range signals needed to reach the putative partner\u2019s burrow are also energetically costly (even using low frequency sounds), and are also costlier than chemical signals because the latter are mostly based in odours present in urine and\/or faeces (<a href=\"#fn49\" id=\"xref49\">Zenuto and Fanjul, 2002<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997323536\">In <i>Ctenomys pearsoni<\/i> -mostly studied in \u201cEstancia El Relincho,\u201d Uruguay (<a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"xref24\">Francescoli, 2011<\/a>)- vocalisations are thought to transfer information about spatial location of individuals, the sex of the emitter and their reproductive condition. Females vary their vocal emissions during the reproductive period (with respect to the rest of the year) by increasing the length and complexity of their vocal emissions at the beginning of the reproductive season, and later decreasing those variables as the reproductive season goes on, probably immediately after being inseminated by a male. This could difficult their location by other males, avoiding harassment and danger of injuries by males trying to reproduce with already inseminated females, and opening the possibility to some sort of sexual selection by the female (<a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"xref19\">Francescoli, 1998<\/a>, <a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"xref20\">1999<\/a>, <a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"xref24\">2011<\/a>). In addition, male vocalisations that are almost invariable and emitted during all the year (<a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"xref24\">Francescoli, 2011<\/a>), can be used by females for sensing the nearby males, thus being able to select the best males when they arrive to the female tunnels for courtship and mating, and also to resist non-preferred males.<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997425824\">The characteristics of different species and study sites (see <a href=\"#T1\">Table 1<\/a>) rise some questions about the communicative and reproductive biology of the studied tuco-tucos, specially in which concerns the use of vocal signals to locate individuals and during the initial steps of courtship in the reproductive season. This detected inter and intraspecific variability could be causing the variation of communicative strategies in reproductive context, probably depending mostly on male\u2019s behaviour, but also depending on the spatial positioning of the individuals in relation to their sex, and on males mobility strategy (subterranean or above ground) to reach the mate.<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid table-container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-sm-8\"><div class=\"img-table-footer row\"><p class=\"fig-title\">Table 1 - Comparison of relevant characteristics of the different <i>Ctenomys<\/i> species and populations discussed in the text.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div class=\"col-sm-4\"><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-right\"><a href=\"#T1\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span>Enlarge Table\n                        <\/a><br\/><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row inline-content\" id=\"article-table\"><div class=\"table-overflow\"><table class=\"table table-hover\" id=\"T1\"><thead><tr><th>Species (Population)<\/th><th align=\"center\">Density<\/th><th align=\"center\">Sex ratio<\/th><th align=\"center\">Predation<\/th><th align=\"center\">Main predators<\/th><th align=\"center\">Activity<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td><i>C. pearsoni<\/i><\/td><td>low\/medium<\/td><td>skewed to females<\/td><td>generalised<\/td><td>foxes (odours)<\/td><td>during day<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><i>C. talarum<\/i> (Mar de Cobo)<\/td><td>high<\/td><td>skewed to females<\/td><td>on juveniles<\/td><td>raptors (vision)<\/td><td>day &amp; night<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><i>C. talarum<\/i> (Necochea)<\/td><td>low<\/td><td>not skewed<\/td><td>on juveniles<\/td><td>raptors (vision)<\/td><td>day &amp; night<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/div><div class=\"table-wrap-foot\"><div class=\"fig-description\"><i>Information sources: For <i>C. pearsoni<\/i> <a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"xref22\">Francescoli et al., 2004<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"xref24\">Francescoli, 2011<\/a>; <i>Francescoli and Izquierdo,<\/i> unpublished data.

The resolution of reproductive events would depend on the use of signals acting at different distances and in different channels, constituting the most important communicative moments in the life of the solitary species of the genus.<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997420544\">Nevertheless, even if male behaviour is central to the definition of the flexibility limits (but see <a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"xref7\">Audet and Lefebvre, 2017<\/a> about the use of the term \u201cbehavioural flexibility\u201d), female behaviour -especially the fact of they vocalising or not- is an extremely important element. Field and laboratory studies in <i>Ctenomys<\/i> suggested that in <i>C. pearsoni, C. mendocinus<\/i>, <i>C. sociabilis<\/i>, <i>C<\/i>. <i>s<\/i>p. \u201cAnillaco\u201d and probably <i>C.\u00a0torquatus<\/i> both sexes vocalise long-range signals, while in <i>C. talarum<\/i> and <i>C. haigi<\/i> only males do it (<a href=\"#fn43\" id=\"xref43\">Schleich and Busch, 2002<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"xref27\">Francescoli and Quirici, 2010<\/a>). As said above, <i>C. pearsoni<\/i> females vary their long range signals throughout the year, vocalising more and longer signals during the initial times of the mating period and decreasing their signalling later into the reproductive season. Females of <i>C.\u00a0talarum<\/i> do not emit long-range signals (<a href=\"#fn43\" id=\"xref43\">Schleich and Busch, 2002<\/a>), while in <i>Ctenomys<\/i> sp. \u201cAnillaco\u201d females seem to scarcely vocalise long-range signals (<a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"xref6\">Amaya et al., 2016<\/a>). A possible explanation of the difference is that population structure also differs between species in which females vocalise and those in which females do not vocalise. In <i>C. talarum<\/i> populations are mainly organised as an addition of groups of some female burrows around a male burrow (but this can vary among populations). In <i>C. pearsoni<\/i> this is not always true because, at least in the better studied populations, females are interspersed with males or many female burrows are \u201cgrouped\u201d surrounded by some males, thus females probably need to make it easier for males to locate them by vocalising (<a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"xref24\">Francescoli, 2011<\/a>; Francescoli and Izquierdo, unpublished data; <a href=\"#fn51\" id=\"xref51\">Zenuto et al., 2002<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997405184\">In <i>C. talarum<\/i> from Mar de Cobo (<a href=\"#fn51\" id=\"xref51\">Zenuto et al., 2002<\/a>) we can expect that males -the sex that moves to the partner\u2019s tunnel- use mostly odour markings previously detected to locate the females (that live around the males), both being sensitised by their odours. They avoid the main predators in the zone (raptors) by moving above ground probably during the night to allow easier location of odour marks outside the burrows, and avoiding the use of long-range vocalisations (not used by females) and probably better detected by raptors. The sex ratio being skewed to females and the disposition of the individuals in the population could help males to attain female burrows using mostly odours as cues, but they will need the use of sounds to repel male competitors (long-range vocalisations), and to continue the courtship when arrived to the female\u2019s tunnel.<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997402336\">In <i>C. talarum<\/i> Necochea the fact that there are no skewed sex ratio and no monopolisation of females by dominant males -in fact no dominance are established between males- results in even numbers of males and females allowing the formation of couples without apparent competition (<a href=\"#fn49\" id=\"xref49\">Zenuto et al., 2002<\/a>). This is probably the reason for the absence of a clear interaction by means of olfactory or vocal signals during courtship and copulation in the laboratory tests.<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997399888\">In <i>C. pearsoni<\/i> (<a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"xref24\">Francescoli, 2011<\/a>; Francescoli and Izquierdo, unpublished data) we can expect that animals (mostly males, the sex that moves to the partner\u2019s tunnel) use sounds emitted by females to locate them, because both sexes use long-range vocalisations allowing space location, and sex and reproductive state identification. They will avoid the main predators in the zone (foxes) by travelling underground during the day or night, and by avoiding the use of external scent-marks that could be easily located by mammalian predators (unlike <i>C. talarum<\/i> males from Mar de Cobo). Sex ratio being skewed towards females could help males to attain female burrows, because of the higher number of females in the population. Nonetheless, the disposition of the individuals in the population will probably constrain males to use acoustic information for location and evaluation of the partner\u2019s sexual condition, these two features being evaluated at distance. Males also use long-range vocalisations to repel male competitors and to continue the courtship when arrived to the female\u2019s tunnel, while females probably identify the male that arrives and select it, avoiding other males that can arrive too, using the information contained on their vocalisations.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139707997395280\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Some conclusions<\/h3><p id=\"idm139707997394480\">Even if the subterranean niche is a stable system, the species inhabiting it are not necessarily as stable as the niche, and are not similar among them. <i>Ctenomys<\/i> in general, and especially the solitary life species, present important differences both at the inter and intraspecific levels. Those differences are clear in the behavioural repertoire and can constrain the communicative and reproductive mechanisms, especially acoustic signals usage, because in many cases acoustic communication has a central role in these processes. Those differences are mostly determined by the external environment, and they determine local variants (adaptations, flexibility, phenotypic plasticity) in the populations.<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997392848\">The apparent variability suggested by the available data could occur even in different populations of the same species. This variability would manifest itself in the use of certain types of long distance signals for the detection of potential partners, in the spatial disposition of individuals according to sex, and in the male mobility strategy (underground or in the surface).<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997392000\">This could be a case of phenotypic plasticity, determining communication strategies variability in reproductive context, apparently depending mostly on long-range communication and the behaviour of males.<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997391328\">The complete understanding of the functional social structure, survival strategies in nature, and successful reproduction of <i>Ctenomys<\/i> is closely associated with the understanding of the signal systems involved in courtship and copulation. The understanding of these signal systems is related mostly to the variable use of vocal signals in the solitary tuco-tuco species, and also to the context in which they were developed and in which they currently function.<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997389936\">To test these variability and the constraints originating it, future studies should try to establish: a) if solitary tuco-tuco populations living in places with abundance of terrestrial predators do use long-range vocalisations to locate each other and connect their tunnels underground when reaching a putative partner for reproduction, and even if juveniles use underground tunnels to disperse, or b) if solitary tuco-tucos living in places with abundance of aerial predators mostly use odours to locate each other, travelling to partner\u2019s tunnels on the surface and mostly at night, and using vocalisations mostly for territorial purposes (especially the females).<\/p><p id=\"idm139707997388800\">This knowledge will eventually allow the planning of conservation actions aimed at maintaining local populations that present particular genetic, morphological and\/or ethological adaptations (<a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"xref2\">Altuna et al., 1999<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"xref23\">Francescoli, 2002<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"xref27\">Francescoli and Quirici, 2010<\/a>).<\/p><\/div><\/div><div id=\"article-back\" class=\"back\"><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139707997382656\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Competing interests<\/h3><p id=\"idm139707997381552\">Gabriel Francescoli declares that he has no conflict of interest.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"back-section\"><a id=\"idm139707997384224\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Acknowledgements<\/h3><p id=\"idm139707997383424\">I want to thank the Editor, Dr. Lee Drickamer and an anonymous reviewer for comments that greatly improved the new version of the manuscript.<\/p><\/div><h3 class=\"main-title\">Funding sources<\/h3><p>Scientific Research Sectorial Commission (CSIC) and National System of Researchers (SNI), Uruguay.<\/p><div class=\"back-section\"><h3 class=\"main-title\">References<\/h3><div class=\"reference-container\" id=\"fn3\"><div><div class=\"ref-content\"><strong>Altuna C.

First, the concept that conflict in the Arctic is a novel phenomenon is dismissed. The second misconception examined is the view that climate change makes natural resources easier to win. The lack of any proven link between climate change and violence is refuted in the light of recent research and juxtaposed with the fear that Russia is in some sense attempting to take over the Arctic region. Finally, the concept that Arctic piracy is entirely a feature of history is exposed as a view that is oblivious to current events. The discussion then concludes with the consideration of the implications of this complex problem for intelligence policy.<\/p>\n<\/div>",

Although only some 6% of the Earth&rsquo;s surface, the Arctic is linked to the rest of the planet geopolitically, as well as by economics and climate; and as that climate changes, so there are potential military ramifications. The simple answer to the question: &ldquo;<em>Will conflict become more likely in the Arctic as the climate changes?<\/em>&rdquo; is <em>yes<\/em>, <em>but not necessarily for the reasons generally discussed<\/em>. This article will explore the complexity of the question via a set of misconceptions, perhaps better described as myths,<sup id=\"xref2\"><a href=\"#fn2\">2<\/a><\/sup> regarding the Arctic. These misconceptions, taken in sum, form a tapestry of misunderstanding that brings little benefit to the policymaker or government servant attempting to create plans in an uncertain world. At best, they have the potential to disrupt the hard-won political progress that is emerging in the Arctic. At worst, they might bring about a self-fulfilling prophesy in which incremental escalation engenders a needless confrontation. This article forms no part of the climate change debate and focuses exclusively on security matters on the assumption that the Arctic climate will change over time.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"s2\"><\/a><!-- named anchor -->\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Myth 1: the risk of Arctic conflict is a new phenomenon<\/h3>\n        <div class=\"blockquote\"><a id=\"d1e201\"><\/a><!-- named anchor -->\n            <p id=\"d1e202\" class=\"first\">...

These graves stand as testimony to the long history of Arctic conflict &mdash; a history that may be traced from the 14th century to the 20th century and the Cold War. Yet, if Arctic nations are indeed bracing themselves against the threat of fresh armed struggle, what casus belli are envisioned as the sources of hostility?<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"s3\"><\/a><!-- named anchor -->\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Myth 2: climate change makes Arctic resources easier to win<\/h3>\n        <div class=\"blockquote\"><a id=\"d1e270\"><\/a><!-- named anchor -->\n            <p id=\"d1e271\" class=\"first\">The rush for the Arctic has become more frenzied because of the melting of parts of the polar ice cap, which will allow easier exploration, and by the urgent need for new sources of oil and gas.<sup id=\"xref26\"><a href=\"#fn25\">26<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n        <\/div>\n        <div class=\"blockquote\"><a id=\"d1e274\"><\/a><!-- named anchor -->\n            <p id=\"d1e275\" class=\"first\">Over the past decade geological surveys have shown that the Arctic has huge underground reservoirs of oil and natural gas. Now that the ice is melting, and the technology and expertise to undertake deep-water drilling has been developed, these resources are for the first time open to exploitation, and they promise to bestow huge benefits on whichever country can claim them as their own.<sup id=\"xref27\"><a href=\"#fn26\">27<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n        <\/div>\n        <p id=\"d1e278\">Roger Howard very properly goes on to follow the second quotation above with cautionary comments regarding the recoverability of Arctic hydrocarbon deposits, and indeed, the reliability of the estimates of their magnitude. Considering the view that climate change makes the resources easier to win, and the associated inferences regarding &ldquo;resource wars&rdquo;, the problem with its validity is in two parts; first, it is technically misleading &mdash; some Arctic resources may become more readily available, while others will face significant challenges that may affect their commercial viability. Second, the assumption that greater resource availability provides a casus belli and necessarily increases the potential for violent conflict is unsupported by the evidence, as will be discussed later. Certainly, natural resources may provide grounds for dispute that collapse into open warfare,<sup id=\"xref28\"><a href=\"#fn27\">28<\/a><\/sup> but the process that leads to conflict is complex, and not all disputed resources give rise to war. The more predictable causal agency in Arctic conflict will be considered later, first however, the issue of additional availability of resources will be addressed in detail.<\/p>\n        <p id=\"d1e282\">The value of a resource depends on its scarcity, and although a very general assessment of Arctic hydrocarbon resources estimated undiscovered reserves at 90 bn barrels of oil and 1,669 tn cu ft of gas,<sup id=\"xref29\"><a href=\"#fn28\">29<\/a><\/sup> the extent to which specific deposits may be exploited depends on market price. Setting aside the reliability of such estimates,<sup id=\"xref30\"><a href=\"#fn29\">30<\/a><\/sup> unless the price for oil renders the potentially enormous cost of Arctic exploration and production competitive on the world market, it will not be commercially viable. Moreover, for producible reserves in disputed areas of the Arctic, neighbour nations are reluctant to jeopardise valuable political relationships over such resources.<sup id=\"xref31\"><a href=\"#fn30\">31<\/a><\/sup> An example of what can go wrong when such relationships are overlooked occurred in 2003, when the US government auctioned oil and gas leases in a disputed region of the Beaufort Sea Ottawa filed a diplomatic protest and faced with the prospect of a long-term legal wrangle, international energy companies withdrew interest.<sup id=\"xref32\"><a href=\"#fn31\">32<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n        <p id=\"d1e291\">There is an assumption that oil and gas development will be aided by warming. New offshore prospects may be easier to access by ship traffic, but in many respects, shore fast ice is a preferable engineering problem, because it is possible to build structures, including ice roads, on such ice.<sup id=\"xref33\"><a href=\"#fn32\">33<\/a><\/sup> Thus, if the prospect is to be developed from an offshore island using techniques such as directional drilling, the island and its associated infrastructure may be constructed using ice roads as a means of access.<sup id=\"xref34\"><a href=\"#fn33\">34<\/a><\/sup> For oil development operations on permafrost, legal permits may specify that drilling is undertaken only during frozen conditions when spills are more easily collected and relief rigs may be deployed on ice roads after a loss of well control incident.<sup id=\"xref35\"><a href=\"#fn34\">35<\/a><\/sup> However, as the climate changes, the period of surface freezing is contracting. Spills in broken sea ice are extremely challenging to deal with.<sup id=\"xref36\"><a href=\"#fn35\">36<\/a><\/sup> They defy boom deployment, combustion is very difficult to sustain,<sup id=\"xref37\"><a href=\"#fn36\">37<\/a><\/sup> and biodegradation may take much longer than at other latitudes.<sup id=\"xref38\"><a href=\"#fn37\">38<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n        <p id=\"d1e305\">Arctic tourism is an economic activity that certainly appears to be flourishing as ice ablation proceeds. The Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment estimated the total number of cruise ship tourists travelling to the Arctic in 2004 at over 1.2 million; by 2007, the number had more than doubled.<sup id=\"xref39\"><a href=\"#fn38\">39<\/a><\/sup> This represents a valuable commercial opportunity and also provides a medium for raising awareness of the Arctic, including its natural environment. Simultaneously, the increment in ship traffic brings environmental and other risks that require proper management.<\/p>\n        <p id=\"d1e309\">A change in Arctic marine ecosystems in response to climate change is already being reported.<sup id=\"xref40\"><a href=\"#fn39\">40<\/a><\/sup> Finfish tend to follow oceanic temperature contours; a northward spread and increased spawning stock biomass and recruitment is being observed in cod.<sup id=\"xref41\"><a href=\"#fn40\">41<\/a><\/sup> Not all of these changes will be beneficial. Some Arctic species are suffering reduction or displacement.<sup id=\"xref42\"><a href=\"#fn41\">42<\/a><\/sup> In terms of conflict between states parties over biological resources, there is at present only one area of significant potential dispute and that is the waters around Svalbard.<sup id=\"xref43\"><a href=\"#fn42\">43<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n        <p id=\"d1e318\">The Northern Sea Route (NSR) has been touted as a potential boon to shipping.<sup id=\"xref44\"><a href=\"#fn43\">44<\/a><\/sup> It is worth noting that some interport distances may be significantly reduced &mdash; 24% or more<sup id=\"xref45\"><a href=\"#fn44\">45<\/a><\/sup> &mdash; although average speeds may be also reduced in some cases by up to 2.6 knots.<sup id=\"xref46\"><a href=\"#fn45\">46<\/a><\/sup> However, the availability of the route depends on the condition of the ice and that is difficult to predict; hence, container traffic may be disadvantaged by comparison with bulk cargo.<sup id=\"xref47\"><a href=\"#fn46\">47<\/a><\/sup> Under United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the Russian government is entitled to levy fair charges for services to vessels using the NSR such as icebreaking and pilotage in their territorial seas (UNCLOS Art 26). Russia may also enforce nondiscriminatory laws and regulations for the prevention, reduction, and control of marine pollution from vessels in ice-covered areas within the limits of its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (UNCLOS Art 234).<\/p>\n        <p id=\"d1e328\">A warming environment in the Arctic does not equate in simple terms to a robust business case for hydrocarbon extraction. A number of complex factors must be taken into account, not the least of which is the means of addressing oil spills in broken sea ice. Oil is not the only resource whose availability and economic viability may alter. Tourism, marine fishing, and marine transport are already exhibiting signs of change. However, the emergence of potential casus belli in the economic realm of the Arctic may not in themselves necessarily indicate conflict.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"s4\"><\/a><!-- named anchor -->\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Myth 3: there is no proven link between climate change and an increase in conflict risk<\/h3>\n        <div class=\"blockquote\"><a id=\"d1e333\"><\/a><!-- named anchor -->\n            <p id=\"d1e334\" class=\"first\">&hellip;the concept of environmentally induced conflict is itself fundamentally flawed, as it neither allows for convincing empirical substantiation nor for sound theory-building.<sup id=\"xref48\"><a href=\"#fn47\">48<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n        <\/div>\n        <p id=\"d1e337\">Conflict prediction has traditionally been held to be impossible in a military context. As Lindley-French and Boyer observe: &ldquo;War is unpredictable, as are its consequences.&rdquo;<sup id=\"xref49\"><a href=\"#fn48\">49<\/a><\/sup> They go on to discuss the blurring between threat and risk.<sup id=\"xref50\"><a href=\"#fn49\">50<\/a><\/sup> This latter distinction is important, because it may lead to significant misjudgements in political and military policy. Following the definition of Singer,<sup id=\"xref51\"><a href=\"#fn50\">51<\/a><\/sup> a threat is defined in military circles as capability coupled with intent.

Perhaps surprisingly, only very few studies on interstate conflict concentrate on the role of other types of natural resources such as oil... although there is a rich qualitative literature on this subject...<sup id=\"xref53\"><a href=\"#fn52\">53<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n        <\/div>\n        <p id=\"d1e372\">Despite the lack of rigorous support for the &ldquo;Arctic casus belli&rdquo; line of reasoning, a numerically based, noncausally focussed approach to conflict prediction has now emerged in a recent determination by Hsiang et al., that climate change entails a higher likelihood of conflict.<sup id=\"xref54\"><a href=\"#fn53\">54<\/a><\/sup> This research may well represent a watershed in a long running dispute on the relationship between climate change and conflict in general. Hsiang et al.<sup id=\"xref55\"><a href=\"#fn54\">55<\/a><\/sup> examined 60 case studies and drew on 45 data sets in an examination of conflict probability that crosses boundaries of scale and geography. Hsiang et al.&rsquo;s<sup id=\"xref56\"><a href=\"#fn55\">56<\/a><\/sup> work identifies a numerically determinable probability of conflict increase in relation to changes in temperature and precipitation. Median estimates indicate that for each standard deviation (1<em>&sigma;<\/em>) towards warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall, the frequency of intergroup violence rises by 14%.<sup id=\"xref57\"><a href=\"#fn56\">57<\/a><\/sup> For reference, inhabited regions of the world are predicted to warm between 2<em>&sigma;<\/em> and 4<em>&sigma;<\/em> by 2050.<sup id=\"xref58\"><a href=\"#fn57\">58<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n        <p id=\"d1e393\">While the research of Hsiang et al.<sup id=\"xref59\"><a href=\"#fn58\">59<\/a><\/sup> provides a quantifiable correlation between climate change and conflict, much work remains to be done to determine the causal process(es) involved. Identifying causal agency is important if political policy for the Arctic is to be properly informed. However, there is less doubt regarding the contribution to climate change, and therefore conflict, made by the Arctic. This contribution is complex and may involve many elements, including the change in albedo as the polar pack melts.<sup id=\"xref60\"><a href=\"#fn59\">60<\/a><\/sup> One key aspect of the process is methane genesis in the Arctic.<sup id=\"xref61\"><a href=\"#fn60\">61<\/a><\/sup> A more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, methane is already bubbling from melting permafrost according to reports by Arctic land and sea expeditions.<sup id=\"xref62\"><a href=\"#fn61\">62<\/a><\/sup> Methane also exists in abundance in the form of methane clathrates within the seabed,<sup id=\"xref63\"><a href=\"#fn62\">63<\/a><\/sup> although the likelihood of that source activating in the short term is considered low.<sup id=\"xref64\"><a href=\"#fn63\">64<\/a><\/sup> Nonetheless, as the Arctic releases quantities of methane into the atmosphere, it contributes to climate change and thereby to the likelihood of violence as correlated by Hsiang et al.<sup id=\"xref65\"><a href=\"#fn64\">65<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n        <p id=\"d1e409\">The key issue that tends to be missed in the literature is that the potential for Arctic conflict is less reliably predicted by reference to casus belli north of the Arctic Circle than to a process under which conflict spreads <em>to<\/em> the region. The involvement of the Arctic in conflict arising elsewhere would be for two reasons. First, the Arctic is where key military resources are based, in particular, the Northern Fleet and a substantial part of Russia&rsquo;s strategic nuclear assets.<sup id=\"xref66\"><a href=\"#fn65\">66<\/a><\/sup> Second, the North Cape is the left flank of NATO&rsquo;s European theatre. In the event of a conflict with Russia, NATO would have to consider engaging in that theatre or risk being outflanked &mdash; perhaps suffering interdiction of reinforcements crossing the Atlantic.<sup id=\"xref67\"><a href=\"#fn66\">67<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n        <p id=\"d1e417\">We may conclude that there is indeed a proven link between climate change and an increased conflict risk, but it is more complex than the emergence of economic opportunities. Instead, the change in albedo and input of methane in the Arctic may alter the climate and bring about conflict that spreads to, rather than from the region. Some opine that the move towards conflict is already underway.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"s5\"><\/a><!-- named anchor -->\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Myth 4: Russia is attempting to take over the Arctic<\/h3>\n        <div class=\"blockquote\"><a id=\"d1e422\"><\/a><!-- named anchor -->\n            <p id=\"d1e423\" class=\"first\">The new Cold War?

Projects include the establishment of ten new &ldquo;emergency-rescue centres&rdquo; at Murmansk, Archangelsk, Naryan-Mar, Vorkuta, Nadym, Dudinka, Tiksi, Pevek, Provideniya, and Andyr.<sup id=\"xref76\"><a href=\"#fn75\">76<\/a><\/sup> It has been inferred that some of these bases will also provide facilities for Northern Fleet and Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (in Russian: <em>Federal'naya sluzhba bezopasnosti Rossiyskoy Federatsii<\/em>, FSB) Border Service vessels.<sup id=\"xref77\"><a href=\"#fn76\">77<\/a><\/sup> Further evidence of Russia&rsquo;s commitment to the Arctic may be found in the recently commissioned nuclear icebreaker 50 Let Pobedy, which required the allocation of 2.5 bn from the federal budget for outfitting.<sup id=\"xref78\"><a href=\"#fn77\">78<\/a><\/sup> However, this programme of refurbishment follows many years of underinvestment. Arguably, considering the size of Russia, her position as a global actor, and the exposure of the economic assets in her polar waters, the current condition of her security forces&ndash;in particular the surface fleet&ndash;is unfit for purpose.<\/p>\n        <p id=\"d1e456\">On 4 August 2015, Russia resubmitted her claim to oceanic boundaries in the Arctic to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf &mdash; as she is entitled to do under the UNCLOS. In fact, in terms of treaty law, Russia has been very active recently. In addition to the Ilulissat declaration of 2008 in collaboration with Canada, Denmark, Greenland, Russia, and the United States &mdash; collectively referred to as the Arctic 5 &mdash; she has signed and ratified a treaty on maritime delimitation and cooperation in the Barents Sea and the Arctic Ocean.<sup id=\"xref79\"><a href=\"#fn78\">79<\/a><\/sup> That agreement entered into force on 7 July 2011,<sup id=\"xref80\"><a href=\"#fn79\">80<\/a><\/sup> ending a 40-year-old border dispute. In May 2011, she concluded with other members of the Arctic Council the Agreement on Cooperation on Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic.<sup id=\"xref81\"><a href=\"#fn80\">81<\/a><\/sup> On July 16, Russia, with the other members of the Arctic 5, made a joint declaration to prevent unregulated commercial fishing in high seas portions of the central Arctic.<sup id=\"xref82\"><a href=\"#fn81\">82<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n        <p id=\"d1e465\">No one is expecting a speedy resolution to the continental shelf-related claims but contrast Russia&rsquo;s recent behaviour to that of other Arctic 5 states &mdash; all of whom are NATO allies. Hans Island in the Nares Strait remains the only disputed landmass in the Arctic.<sup id=\"xref83\"><a href=\"#fn82\">83<\/a><\/sup> The island, a mere half square mile in extent, lies between the defined end points of two lines that delineate the respective law of the sea claims of Canada and Denmark.<sup id=\"xref84\"><a href=\"#fn83\">84<\/a><\/sup> It is a shortfall in cartographic diplomacy, yet attempts to solve the dispute have so far brought no progress.<sup id=\"xref85\"><a href=\"#fn84\">85<\/a><\/sup> Similarly, the dispute between Canada and the United States concerning the maritime boundary in the Beaufort Sea is unresolved, as is the legal status of the Northwest Passage.<sup id=\"xref86\"><a href=\"#fn85\">86<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n        <p id=\"d1e474\">Although sovereignty remains an issue in the Arctic, the Norwegian\/Russian settlement regarding the Barents represents significant progress. Unofficial agreements and diplomatic communications appear to be solving other disputes.<sup id=\"xref87\"><a href=\"#fn86\">87<\/a><\/sup> Such was the case in 2005 when the Russian trawler <em>Elektron<\/em> made a dash for home waters during an inspection by two Norwegian fisheries inspectors.<sup id=\"xref88\"><a href=\"#fn87\">88<\/a><\/sup> The Norwegian officials were still on board at the time.<sup id=\"xref89\"><a href=\"#fn88\">89<\/a><\/sup> Although potentially serious, this incident was solved by diplomatic means, and the Russian Navy refused to become involved.<sup id=\"xref90\"><a href=\"#fn89\">90<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n        <p id=\"d1e486\">The Arctic 5 have made it clear in the Ilulissat declaration of 2008 that they want no Arctic treaty of the type created for Antarctica. Instead, they wish to solve issues themselves using the law of the sea provisions. Indeed, there seems to be a preference for excluding NATO from disputes, despite the fact that four members of the Arctic 5 are also from NATO nations. Any argument that Russia is attempting to effect Arctic territorial acquisition in an aggressive manner must therefore first dismiss two critical pieces of evidence: Russia&rsquo;s recent record of obedience to the tenets of treaty law, and its lack of the military wherewithal to impose a territorial gain by force. Other displays, such as planting seafloor flags or military exercises, should first be evaluated in the context of their domestic appeal.<\/p>\n        <p id=\"d1e488\">Any conclusive evidence that Russia intends to gain sovereignty over areas in the Arctic by means other than those accepted within the tenets of international diplomacy has yet to emerge. However, nation states are not the only parties capable of acts of violence in the Arctic.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"s6\"><\/a><!-- named anchor -->\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Myth 5: there is no risk of piracy in the Arctic<\/h3>\n        <div class=\"blockquote\"><a id=\"d1e493\"><\/a><!-- named anchor -->\n            <p id=\"d1e494\" class=\"first\">&hellip;no piracy or terrorism issues from Arctic waters around Iceland and East Greenland have ever been reported.<sup id=\"xref91\"><a href=\"#fn90\">91<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n        <\/div>\n        <p id=\"d1e497\">One of the advantages touted for the NSR is a lack of piracy.<sup id=\"xref92\"><a href=\"#fn91\">92<\/a><\/sup> In fact, an examination of reports by shipping insurance companies reveals that at the global level, the industry is not particularly exercised by such losses.<sup id=\"xref93\"><a href=\"#fn92\">93<\/a><\/sup> Moreover, piracy has declined significantly of late, from 445 attacks<sup id=\"xref94\"><a href=\"#fn93\">94<\/a><\/sup> in 2010 to 245 in 2014.<sup id=\"xref95\"><a href=\"#fn94\">95<\/a><\/sup> Yet, the Arctic does suffer a form of piracy, one that is likely to see an increase as the climate changes, and indeed, one that may in due course lead to violence.<\/p>\n        <p id=\"d1e507\">Piracy may be defined in various ways,<sup id=\"xref96\"><a href=\"#fn95\">96<\/a><\/sup> and one of them is illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing. IUU or pirate fishing represents a significant environmental threat.<sup id=\"xref97\"><a href=\"#fn96\">97<\/a><\/sup> Without proper records, there can be no reliable scientifically informed management of the catch. It is also economically injurious.<sup id=\"xref98\"><a href=\"#fn97\">98<\/a><\/sup> The ransom money taken by Somali pirates between 2005 and 2012 has been estimated by the UN and the World Bank at between $US 399&ndash;413m.<sup id=\"xref99\"><a href=\"#fn98\">99<\/a><\/sup> Contrast this with the estimated value of over 100,000 tons of cod caught illegally in the Barents for 2005 alone &mdash; $350m.<sup id=\"xref100\"><a href=\"#fn99\">100<\/a><\/sup> The annual legal catch of this species in the region is some 450,000 tons.<sup id=\"xref101\"><a href=\"#fn100\">101<\/a><\/sup> As the 21st century progresses and protein sources become scarcer, pirate fishing will become more lucrative. It is already the case that the value of the catch in a pirate vessel&rsquo;s hold can exceed the value of the vessel itself.<sup id=\"xref102\"><a href=\"#fn101\">102<\/a><\/sup> There is a potential for conflict at the subnational scale over the illegal harvesting of biomarine resources. To give just one example, it is reported that in the so-called Turbot War, Canadian warships fired warning shots to Spanish trawlers just outside of Canadian waters.<sup id=\"xref103\"><a href=\"#fn102\">103<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n        <p id=\"d1e525\">Violence may come about in the Arctic at the subnation state level as a result of marine resource conflict. There are precedents in fishing grounds in other parts of the world, and the value of the commodities involved creates a powerful incentive for unlawful behaviour. As with any form of organised criminal activity, one of the principal measures to manage the risk will be the provision of intelligence.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"s7\"><\/a><!-- named anchor -->\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Discussion &mdash; what are the implications for intelligence policy?<\/h3>\n        <p id=\"d1e530\">The geopolitical and economic effects of climate change on the Arctic region are already manifesting themselves. To date, there has been much discussion of the potential for those effects to give rise to conflict. However, much of the discussion has focussed on less probable causal factors and largely ignored those that more likely, and indeed, might be mitigated with concerted political and military action.<\/p>\n        <p id=\"d1e532\">The problem of climate-induced Arctic conflict may be considered as three threats, which will be addressed in turn:<\/p>\n        <p id=\"d1e534\"><em>Interstate conflict.<\/em> Much has been written regarding extant territorial disputes between the Arctic five countries,<sup id=\"xref104\"><a href=\"#fn103\">104<\/a><\/sup> yet there are strong indications that such disputes will be solved through political and diplomatic discourse. &Aring;tland notes the potentially serious nature of the above-mentioned <em>Elektron<\/em> episode:<\/p>\n        <div class=\"blockquote\"><a id=\"d1e543\"><\/a><!-- named anchor -->\n            <p id=\"d1e544\" class=\"first\">The trawler refused to follow instructions given by the Norwegians, and suddenly took off from its pursuers, with two Coast Guard inspectors still on board. This lead (sic) to a three-day chase through the Barents Sea&hellip; Contrary to what many expected at the outset of the pursuit, the <em>Elektron<\/em> incident did not escalate to become a militarized interstate dispute between Norway and Russia. Instead, it was handled in a non-confrontational manner by diplomats, and later, the judicial system.<sup id=\"xref105\"><a href=\"#fn104\">105<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n        <\/div>\n        <p id=\"d1e550\">The most significant issue is the potential for climate change to increase the risk of conflict between NATO members and Russia through the now proven link between environmental change and violence,<sup id=\"xref106\"><a href=\"#fn105\">106<\/a><\/sup> and for that dispute to spread <em>to<\/em> the Arctic nations.<sup id=\"xref107\"><a href=\"#fn106\">107<\/a><\/sup> The northern seas are the bastion in which the Northern Fleet nuclear assets are protected, and the North Cape is a point of emergence if Russia wishes to interdict NATO&rsquo;s Atlantic resupply or flank the NATO European battlespace. A European conflict, however initiated, will inevitably have the potential to spread to that part of the Arctic. The indications are that Arctic nations are reinforcing their intelligence operations in line with the need to collect and analyse the information necessary to anticipate and thwart military conflict.<sup id=\"xref108\"><a href=\"#fn107\">108<\/a><\/sup> However, there are further dimensions to enhanced intelligence activity in the Arctic:<\/p>\n        <p id=\"d1e561\"><em>Nonstate conflict.<\/em> Included within this threat are piracy in the form of illegal and unregulated fishing, and insurgency. The collaborative policing of Arctic biomarine resources is not merely beneficial for the protection of the ecosystem, it also represents an opportunity to build and reinforce much needed links between Arctic, and indeed other nations.<\/p>\n        <p id=\"d1e565\">Another source of potential subnational scale conflict from which the Arctic is not immune is insurgency. Due to the remoteness of the Arctic and difficulty in policing the areas involved, high visibility attacks against relatively modestly defended targets such as oil installations and cruise ships could confer publicity of the sort attractive to insurgents. Nacos cites one source that exemplifies the view of insurgents in their desire to obtain press coverage and public attention: &ldquo;we would throw roses if it would work.&rdquo;<sup id=\"xref109\"><a href=\"#fn108\">109<\/a><\/sup> A burning Arctic oil rig or cruise liner would capture such attention. Certainly, the logistical difficulties involved in an Arctic attack would diminish its likelihood for many insurgent groups but not eliminate it. Indeed, if the intention was merely to board and disable a vessel, or inflict great economic damage without sinking it, the problem is greatly simplified. In this context, Lehr notes:<\/p>\n        <div class=\"blockquote\"><a id=\"d1e569\"><\/a><!-- named anchor -->\n            <p id=\"d1e570\" class=\"first\">&hellip;it can be expected that such acts of ecoterrorism will increase in frequency over the next couple of years, affecting other types of ships more and more. Vessels transporting hazardous cargoes such as nuclear waste or chemicals readily come to mind, and so do offshore installations such as oil rigs or mobile drilling platforms, especially so if they are intended for explorative drilling in the previously &ldquo;pristine&rdquo; Arctic or Antarctic waters.<sup id=\"xref110\"><a href=\"#fn109\">110<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n        <\/div>\n        <p id=\"d1e573\">For attacks against terrestrial installations, the logistical challenge for the perpetrator may be simpler still.<\/p>\n        <p id=\"d1e575\">The insurgency threat is primarily a question of protecting remote and valuable economic assets: oil installations, pipelines, and cruise ships. Extending the collaboration between the Arctic nations offers an opportunity to mitigate the risk and strengthen trust.<\/p>\n        <p id=\"d1e578\">The Arctic 5 have common enemies in the nonstate conflict sphere. Sharing information and resources would confer soft power advantages, and in the context of intelligence for nonstate conflict, it is worth remembering that in the Arctic, all collection assets may be needed in order to dominate the battlespace. For example, in the terrestrial environment, a surveillance role is played by ranger organisations such as the Canadian Rangers<sup id=\"xref111\"><a href=\"#fn110\">111<\/a><\/sup> and the Danish Navy&rsquo;s Sirius sledge patrol in the northeast Greenland national park.<sup id=\"xref112\"><a href=\"#fn111\">112<\/a><\/sup> The challenge is to integrate information collected by all assets into a comprehensive counterinsurgency intelligence picture. In this context, not only does shared information become the currency of trust but also such activities may involve the participation of indigenous people, emphasising their value to their respective Arctic polities and providing a medium for transmitting traditional skills and values.<\/p>\n        <p id=\"d1e584\"><em>The third threat<\/em> is potentially the most severe &mdash; and perhaps the most overlooked. It is the risk that the community of nations will miss an opportunity to mitigate one of the worst risks of climate change &mdash; oceanic depletion.<sup id=\"xref113\"><a href=\"#fn112\">113<\/a><\/sup> The Arctic is of great significance as a political experiment. There are promising signs that political development in that region is rising to the challenge of climate change by emphasising local sovereignty and extant treaty law. As McGinn notes:<\/p>\n        <div class=\"blockquote\"><a id=\"d1e590\"><\/a><!-- named anchor -->\n            <p id=\"d1e591\" class=\"first\">The Law of the Sea established a comprehensive framework governing ocean use and set such use in the context of environmental protection. Also for the first time, the Law of the Sea established a compulsory dispute resolution mechanism, referring unresolved issues to an international law tribunal. Rather than trying to address every individual concern and anticipate future issues, it recognized the need for parties to negotiate complementary and specific agreements.<sup id=\"xref114\"><a href=\"#fn113\">114<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n        <\/div>\n        <p id=\"d1e594\">Such adaptability and political will is essential if the largest habitat on the planet &mdash; the global ocean &mdash; is to be managed responsibly. The Arctic may prove a much needed model of collaboration to be emulated in other parts of the planet, and in this context, political intelligence will be important in supporting negotiations and warning of potentially destabilising factors in treaty management.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"s8\"><\/a><!-- named anchor -->\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Conclusions<\/h3>\n        <p id=\"d1e599\">This article has considered and redressed five myths regarding climate change and Arctic security. The simple answer to the question &ldquo;<em>Will conflict become more likely in the Arctic as the climate changes?<\/em>&rdquo; is <em>yes<\/em>, <em>but not necessarily for the reasons generally discussed<\/em>. The Arctic is a battlefield of ancient standing with brutal conditions. Climate change does not necessarily make Arctic resources easier to obtain, and when it does, there may be additional complications and consequences. There is now a proven link between climate change and an increase in conflict risk &mdash; violence at the interstate level is likely to spread to the Arctic. There is no sound evidence that Russia is trying to &ldquo;take over the Arctic&rdquo; and, in fact, has gone out of its way to work within treaty law. Finally, there are pirates in the Arctic &mdash; and they are a threat not only to the Arctic economy but also to its ecosystem.<\/p>\n        <p id=\"d1e610\">The recent history and statistical lessons are clear &mdash; climate change will increase the probability of military and other forms of conflict in the Arctic. Intelligence will have a significant role in mitigating these risks by providing information regarding the potential for a military conflict that may spread to the Arctic. However, the more substantial tasks for the Intelligence Community may be in fostering trust through joint counterinsurgency operations and the support of the Arctic diplomacy that forms a model on which to confront the broader challenge of oceanic depletion. To ignore such an opportunity may in time prove the greatest risk of all.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"article-back\" class=\"back\">\n    <div class=\"section\"><a id=\"d1e613\"><\/a><!-- named anchor -->\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Conflict of Interests<\/h3>\n        <p id=\"d1e616\">John Ash declares that he has no conflict of interest.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <h3 class=\"main-title\">Funding sources<\/h3>\n    <p>Nil.<\/p>\n    <div class=\"back-section\"><a id=\"idm320520199680\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a>\n\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Footnotes<\/h3>\n\n        <div class=\"reference-container\" id=\"fn1\">\n            <div>\n                <div class=\"pull-left\"><strong><span class=\"generated\">1<\/span><\/strong><\/div>\n                <div class=\"ref-content\">The definition of the Arctic used for this article will be that adopted by\n                    AMAP, <i>Arctic Pollution Issues: a State of the Arctic Environment Report<\/i> (Oslo: Arctic\n                    Monitoring and Assessment Programme, 1997), 6\u20137, <a target=\"_blank\"\n                                                                        href=\"http:\/\/www.amap.no\/documents\/download\/70\"\n                                                                        id=\"idm320520197632\">http:\/\/www.amap.no\/documents\/download\/70<\/a>.\n                    This includes the oceanic areas to the north of the Aleutian chain in the Pacific, and 62\u00b0 N in the\n                    Atlantic, but including the Faeroes, the Labrador and Greenland Seas.

First, the concept that conflict in the Arctic is a novel phenomenon is dismissed. The second misconception examined is the view that climate change makes natural resources easier to win. The lack of any proven link between climate change and violence is refuted in the light of recent research and juxtaposed with the fear that Russia is in some sense attempting to take over the Arctic region. Finally, the concept that Arctic piracy is entirely a feature of history is exposed as a view that is oblivious to current events. The discussion then concludes with the consideration of the implications of this complex problem for intelligence policy.",

      "abstract": "<div id=\"abstract\" class=\"abstract\"><p id=\"idm45071167834816\">The ambient acoustic environment, or soundscape, is of broad interest in the study of marine ecosystems as both a source of rich sensory information to marine organisms and, more broadly, as a driver of the structure and function of marine communities. Increasing our understanding of how soundscapes affect and reflect ecological processes first requires appropriate characterization of the acoustic stimuli, and their patterns in space and time. Here, we present a novel method developed for measuring soundscape variation, using drifting acoustic recorders to quantify acoustic dynamics related to benthic habitat composition. Selected examples of drifter results from sub-tidal oyster-reef habitats in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA, and from coral reef habitats in St. John, US Virgin Islands, highlight the efficacy and utility of this approach in quantifying soundscape variation in diverse habitats. The platform introduces minimal noise into the acoustic recordings, and allows sampling at spatial scales that might typically be overlooked using stationary hydrophone methods. We demonstrate that mobile hydrophone recording methods offer new insight into soundscape variation and provide a complementary approach to conventional passive acoustic monitoring techniques.<\/p><\/div>\n",

In marine bioacoustics, passive acoustic assessments have long been centered on the specific communicative signals of mammals and fishes (Reviewed in: <a href=\"#fn31\" id=\"xref31\">Myrberg Jr., 1997<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn41\" id=\"xref41\">Ramcharitar et al., 2006<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"xref13\">Fay et al., 2008<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn55\" id=\"xref55\">Van Parijs et al., 2009<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn57\" id=\"xref57\">Zimmer, 2011<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"xref2\">Au and Lammers, 2016<\/a>). More recently, however, the totality of the acoustic environment comprising all biological, geophysical, and anthropogenic sources has been documented as an important source of sensory information for organisms of a broader range of taxa, and the composition of soundscapes is now implicated in numerous behavioral and ecological processes (<a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"xref7\">Cotter, 2008<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"xref12\">Fay, 2009<\/a>). Moreover, the recognition that marine ecosystems are facing anthropogenic noise pressures, as well as habitat changes that may alter the structure and function of soundscapes, has driven research on the relationship between ecological processes and underwater soundscapes (<i>e.g.<\/i>, <a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"xref23\">Lillis et al., 2014b<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn44\" id=\"xref44\">Rupp\u00e9 et al., 2015<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"xref18\">Kaplan et al., 2015<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"xref4\">Bohnenstiehl et al., 2016<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"xref6\">Butler et al., 2016<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"xref3\">Bertucci et al., 2016<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn50\" id=\"xref50\">Staaterman et al., 2017<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm45071172138352\">Adequate characterization of the acoustic environment is an essential first step to develop and test hypotheses in the burgeoning discipline of soundscape ecology. New acoustic analysis approaches to quantify the spatiotemporal variation in ambient sound continue to be developed and applied in both terrestrial and marine systems (<i>e.g.<\/i>, <a href=\"#fn53\" id=\"xref53\">Sueur et al., 2008<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn35\" id=\"xref35\">Pijanowski et al., 2011<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"xref14\">Gasc et al., 2013<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"xref28\">McWilliam and Hawkins, 2013<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"xref22\">Lillis et al., 2014a<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn51\" id=\"xref51\">Staaterman et al., 2014<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn33\" id=\"xref33\">Pieretti et al., 2017<\/a>). Studies in shallow water coastal and estuarine systems provide evidence that soundscapes reflect specific benthic habitat types (<i>e.g.<\/i>, rocky reefs, coral reefs, oyster reefs), as well as the structure of marine communities (<a href=\"#fn39\" id=\"xref39\">Radford et al., 2010<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"xref22\">Lillis et al., 2014a<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn32\" id=\"xref32\">Piercy et al., 2014<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"xref18\">Kaplan et al., 2015<\/a>). These distinct acoustic characteristics may, in turn, influence key ecological processes such as larval fish and invertebrate orientation and settlement (<a href=\"#fn37\" id=\"xref37\">Radford et al., 2007<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn47\" id=\"xref47\">Simpson et al., 2008<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn52\" id=\"xref52\">Stanley et al., 2011<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"xref21\">Lillis et al., 2013<\/a>). Given that underwater soundscapes can exhibit high spatiotemporal variation, yet logistical constraints may limit data collection to few hydrophones and\/or small deployment windows, interpreting ecological meaning from soundscape \u201csnapshots\u201d can be challenging (<a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"xref28\">McWilliam and Hawkins, 2013<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"xref24\">Lillis et al., 2016<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm45071172132272\">The benthos of estuarine and coastal areas typically comprise a mosaic of different habitat types. For instance, coastal and estuarine habitats may transition from reef to sandflat to seagrass to reef over relatively small spatial scales (<a href=\"#fn46\" id=\"xref46\">Sheaves, 2009<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"xref22\">Lillis et al., 2014a<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn42\" id=\"xref42\">Ricci et al., 2016<\/a>). The acoustic characterization of such environments at appropriate spatiotemporal scales is particularly challenging. For example, while sound may propagate long distances in open-ocean free-field environments (<a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"xref1\">Au and Hastings, 2008<\/a>), propagation and attenuation patterns are often not well-known in nearshore-coastal habitats (but see [<a href=\"#fn40\" id=\"xref40\">Radford et al., 2011<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"xref22\">Lillis et al., 2014a<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"xref17\">Kaplan and Mooney, 2016<\/a>]) and distinct soundscapes may not actually propagate far in structurally complex shallow water habitats. Stationary acoustic recorders provide high temporal fidelity for passive acoustic monitoring in a given location, and measurements at multiple locations may help identify spatial differences, however, multiple passive acoustic recorders can still prove costly and selection of appropriate deployment sites challenging. These limits in technology and logistical constraints create trade-offs in sampling designs that require creative and carefully conceived approaches to meet the goals of the soundscape measurement.<\/p><p id=\"idm45071172160208\">With these considerations in mind, we developed a measurement approach using passive drifting hydrophone recorders to explore estuarine and coastal soundscape dynamics with fine spatiotemporal resolution, complementary to stationary recording platforms. Since drifters move with and at the speed of ocean currents, they mimic the acoustic experience of passive planktonic organisms and are well-suited for capturing acoustic variability at scales relevant to processes such as larval dispersal and habitat selection (<a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"xref23\">Lillis et al., 2014b<\/a>). Moreover, drifters offer a technique to efficiently survey the soundscape across a study area and inform the development of long-term stationary recording schemes (<i>i.e.<\/i>, measure scales of spatial variability, identify locations of particular acoustic interest). Gliders, autonomous vehicles, or other mobile hydrophone platforms also provide a method to acoustically sample over multiple scales and along programmed paths of interest, but typically have separate moving parts or motors which can generate substantial self-noise or flow-noise (<i>e.g.<\/i>, <a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"xref26\">Matsumoto et al., 2011<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"xref26\">Klinck et al., 2012<\/a>). By moving with the current, and having no moving parts, drifters have the potential to generate relatively low levels of self-noise, thus broadening the dynamic range of potential soundscape measurements and the ability to capture low-amplitude sounds previously identified only through stationary recorders. Previously, free-drifting underwater recorders have been used as a tool to detect and localize marine mammals (<a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"xref20\">Laurinolli et al., 2003<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn49\" id=\"xref49\">\u0160irovi\u0107 and Hildebrand, 2011<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn29\" id=\"xref29\">Mooney et al., 2013<\/a>), however, similar instruments rarely been applied in shallow-water environments, or to characterize variation in soundscapes.<\/p><p id=\"idm45071172220752\">Here, we describe the use of passive acoustic drifters in two case studies, applying the approach to a temperate and a tropical system, to highlight the importance of passive acoustic measurements over multiple scales and illustrate the potential value of including a dynamic data collection method in soundscape studies. The objective is to describe an underutilized approach in marine soundscape ecology and to illustrate the utility and potential caveats of applying this technique to measure near-shore marine soundscapes.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45071172222064\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Materials and methods<\/h3><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45071172222432\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Drifting acoustic recorders<\/h4><p id=\"idm45071172224752\">Two types of drifting passive acoustic recorders were used in soundscape characterization efforts described here. The first version of drifting hydrophone units, initially developed in 2012 for use in estuarine habitats, were constructed from a small free-floating water-tight plastic barrel (40\u00a0cm length \u00d7 15\u00a0cm diameter) containing a handheld GPS unit, and an M-audio Microtrack II recorder (48\u00a0kHz sampling rate, 24 bit digitization) connected to an external omnidirectional calibrated hydrophone (Sensor Technology SQ-26-08: flat frequency response over the range of 0.1\u201324\u00a0kHz with a sensitivity \u2212169\u00a0dB re 1\u00a0V\/\u03bcPa; or High Tech Inc HTI-96-MIN: flat frequency response over the range of 0.02\u201324\u00a0kHz with a sensitivity \u2212165\u00a0dB re 1\u00a0V\/\u03bcPa) (<a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1a<\/a>). The hydrophone was suspended at 0.75\u20131\u00a0m depth from the surface using a weighted line. Due to the shallow depths present in this estuarine study system, the hydrophone placement depth was chosen to best avoid contact with high relief reef structure within oyster reserves, while minimizing surface and flow noise around a mobile hydrophone.<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F1\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/d929d697-d328-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/dicta_est_debitis_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/d929d697-d328-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/dicta_est_debitis_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/d929d697-d328-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JEA-00017-2017-02_F0001.tif\" download=\"JEA-00017-2017-02_F0001.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 1 - Schematic of drifting underwater acoustic recorder units, showing customizable features.<\/p><div class=\"fig-description\"><i>(a) Original basic design used in shallow estuarine habitats in North Carolina, and (b) modified design for use in coastal Caribbean reefs, including multiple hydrophones, compass, camera, and transmitting GPS.<\/i><\/div><\/div><\/div><p id=\"idm45071172228752\">The second version of drifting acoustic recorders was developed in 2017 for use in Caribbean coral reef systems (<a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1b<\/a>).

Reef habitat in this experiment ranged from 4\u201320\u00a0meters depth, allowing the hydrophone array to be placed slightly deeper than the previous version, at approximately 1.5\u20132\u00a0m below the water surface. The above-surface module held a GPS device that logged and transmitted drifter locations to a handheld device (Garmin Astro\u00ae 320). A compass and 3-dimensional accelerometer measurement device was attached to the hydrophone array to add directional\/localization capabilities. Additionally, a GoPro waterproof camera was included in the re-design, allowing video and photo confirmation of the benthic habitats over which the drifter traversed.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45071172055776\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Study sites and deployments<\/h4><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45071172057792\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h5 class=\"section-title\">Study 1: Estuarine habitats in Pamlico Sound, NC, USA<\/h5><p id=\"idm45071170570112\">Pamlico Sound, North Carolina is a large lagoonal estuary located in the Southeastern United States (<a href=\"#F2\">Figure 2<\/a>). Oyster reefs in this system provide three-dimensional structured habitat for a variety of finfish and invertebrate species, and host a distinct ecological community compared to off-reef unstructured soft bottom habitats (<a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"xref5\">Boudreaux et al., 2006<\/a>). Previous acoustic recordings made using stationary hydrophone systems showed that oyster reef habitats in Pamlico Sound, NC consistently had distinct acoustic characteristics compared to simultaneously sampled adjacent off-reef soft bottoms (<a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"xref22\">Lillis et al., 2014a<\/a>), and experimental work provided evidence that settling oyster larvae can be influenced by the habitat-associated sounds (<a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"xref21\">Lillis et al., 2013<\/a>). However, variation within reserve sites could not easily be measured with a limited number of stationary hydrophones, and short-term recordings indicated that acoustic characteristics could vary considerably over short distances (&lt;50\u00a0m) within reefs.

These reserves provide protected habitat where reef communities, including numerous finfish and invertebrates, have become established (<a href=\"#fn36\" id=\"xref36\">Puckett and Eggleston, 2012<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn30\" id=\"xref30\">Mroch et al., 2012<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn34\" id=\"xref34\">Pierson and Eggleston, 2014<\/a>). The reserves, located throughout Pamlico Sound, are typically surrounded by featureless soft bottom habitat. Reserve areas range between 0.02\u20130.19\u00a0km<sup>2<\/sup> and, within their boundaries, contain discrete patches of reef material in various configurations. Because these reserves are located throughout the large estuary (<a href=\"#F2\">Figure 2<\/a>), and are mapped in terms of reef structure and layout, they provided a model system in which to evaluate the use of drifting hydrophones to link acoustic patterns to small-scale changes in benthic habitat structure.<\/p><p id=\"idm45071172184800\">Drifter surveys were conducted during daylong site visits to five oyster reserves (labeled in <a href=\"#F2\">Figure 2<\/a>) during the summer (July and August 2012). At each site, drifter units were deployed in the water approximately  500\u20131,000\u00a0m upstream of the reserve boundaries in a position projected to produce a drift crossing the reef area. Following deployment, the small boat was moved a sufficient distance to avoid interference with the recordings while maintaining visual contact (~500\u00a0m), and the motor was turned off for the duration of a drift. Hydrophones were allowed to drift across the reserve site until they were approximately 500\u20131,000\u00a0m downstream of the reserve, producing drifts ranging from 45\u201390 minutes depending on current speed.

Results of the initial acoustic data collection revealed significant intra- and inter-site variation in sound pressure levels and patterns in sound production, particularly by dominant sound producers such as snapping shrimp, at scales of hundreds of meters (<a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"xref18\">Kaplan et al., 2015<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"xref25\">Lillis and Mooney, 2016<\/a>). Because a major objective of the larger USVI reef study is to examine relationships between soundscape variation, reef characteristics, and larval recruitment, mobile hydrophone deployments offered a useful platform with which to characterize soundscape variation in the study area at scales relevant to changes in benthic habitat composition and larval transport. Drifting hydrophones as in <a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1b<\/a> were released within coastal areas on the south side of the island of St. John to collect acoustic data across sandy bottom, coral rubble, and within coral reef habitat (5\u201315\u00a0m depth range) during 1\u20132 hour deployments. The experiments were restricted to daytime hours. Deployment methods were adapted from those described above for use in the coastal embayments, with drifters released depending on current direction, and aimed to result in the drifter traversing sandy bottom and coral patches of interest (sites labeled in <a href=\"#F3\">Figure 3<\/a>). Following drifter release, the boat was moored ~1\u00a0km away and drifter locations were monitored via the handheld GPS receiver.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45071172146912\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Data analysis<\/h4><p id=\"idm45071172153104\">Acoustic recordings were analyzed with Matlab code written to generate waveforms and spectrograms for the durations of each drift. Prior to analysis, recordings were audited and raw data visually inspected to facilitate removal of the boat noise associated with deployment and retrieval activity. The truncated recordings were then analyzed by filtering the sound to compute the root-mean square (rms) sound pressure levels in a lower (100\u20132,000\u00a0Hz) and higher (2,000\u201320,000\u00a0Hz) frequency band to broadly examine the variation in sound levels attributable to changes in dominant sound sources during a drift. The frequency bands were selected based on previous soundscape characterization studies examining estuarine habitats in Pamlico Sound (<a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"xref22\">Lillis et al., 2014a<\/a>) and coastal reefs in St. John (<a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"xref18\">Kaplan et al., 2015<\/a>), that detected habitat-related differences in these bandwidths, which are generally associated with different acoustic sources. Sound in the 100\u20132,000\u00a0Hz band is biologically dominated by fish vocalizations (<a href=\"#fn41\" id=\"xref41\">Ramcharitar et al., 2006<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"xref13\">Fay et al., 2008<\/a>), and contains much of the acoustic energy produced by wind and waves (<a href=\"#fn56\" id=\"xref56\">Wenz, 1962<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn54\" id=\"xref54\">Urick, 1984<\/a>), while the higher frequency 2,000\u201320,000\u00a0Hz band is dominated by snapping shrimp <i>Alpheus<\/i> spp. activity (<a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"xref10\">Everest, 1948<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn45\" id=\"xref45\">Schmitz, 2002<\/a>). Recordings from St. John 2017 drifts were additionally analyzed specifically for snapping shrimp content, by applying a snap detector (as in <a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"xref4\">Bohnenstiehl et al., 2016<\/a>) for each 1-minute window of drift audio, to examine snap rates across the duration of drifts.<\/p><p id=\"idm45071172118928\">To further assess the change in frequency composition and sound intensities at different frequencies over the length of each drifter recording, spectrograms were produced using 0.5-second windows with 25% overlap. GPS data were used to generate a map for each drift. For Study 1 (Pamlico Sound, NC), reserve boundaries and reef structure locations (obtained from NC Division of Marine Fisheries) were plotted on drift maps, while available benthic habitat maps (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/maps.coastalscience.noaa.gov\/\" id=\"idm45071172118160\">https:\/\/maps.coastalscience.noaa.gov\/<\/a>) were used for drift maps in Study 2 (St. John, USVI). Based on these maps, the recording times during which the hydrophone was positioned above reef structure and in proximity to other features was determined, and the acoustic waveforms and spectrograms were directly compared to the drifter positions to evaluate the correspondence of acoustic variation to variation in benthic habitat structure.<\/p><p id=\"idm45071172217680\">The coastal St. John study area is characterized by prevailing easterly winds and currents, and 1\u20131.5\u00a0m wave heights were measured at a nearby oceanographic data buoy (NOAA National Data Buoy Center Station 41052) during drifter deployment periods. As a result, transient mechanical interference was detected on hydrophones intermittently during drifts, as the units moved. Because these sounds contributed unwanted noise to the lower analysis band, and to test if valuable biological data (<i>e.g.<\/i>, fish calls) could still be extracted with this method, recordings were filtered to remove any 1-second samples that contained high-amplitude low-frequency interference, as confirmed by manual inspection of spectrograms and auditing. Although data from multiple hydrophones was collected using a 4-channel recorder on each drifter in the second study, because the objective of the present analysis is to test and illustrate the utility of drifter soundscape measurements in the coastal coral reef environments, here we limit results to single hydrophone data. Future applications will obtain directional information from the hydrophone array and compass features of this drifter design.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45071172196032\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Results<\/h3><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45071172190768\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Study 1: Estuarine habitats in Pamlico Sound, NC, USA<\/h4><p id=\"idm45071172213200\">Twenty-four successful drifter deployments were conducted during 2012 at five study sites (4\u20136 per site). After initial testing and development, drifter units were straight-forward to use, and unsuccessful deployments were rare, but included instances where drifters did not move across the intended areas due to unpredictable currents or winds, and times when the acoustic recorder or battery pack failed. When possible, two drifter units were deployed in tandem, providing redundancy if a recording failed and most often generating simultaneous replicate drift recordings. A comparison of drifter recordings and concurrent measurements made with a stationary hydrophone indicated that the noise due to flow and wave motion was primarily below 100\u00a0Hz and therefore largely excluded from our analysis bands. Drifter speeds varied between 0.12\u20130.30\u00a0m\/s, comparable to commonly observed Pamlico Sound surface current speeds (<a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"xref15\">Haase et al., 2012<\/a>) and therefore provided realistic space-time scales of soundscape variation for the intended application of making inferences about the acoustic experience of planktonic animals.<\/p><p id=\"idm45071172184176\">Drift acoustic recordings revealed variation in the estuarine soundscape at multiple spatial scales.

(2014b)<\/a>, in the context of larval settlement). Higher sound pressure levels, particularly in the upper frequency band, were detected during transit within oyster reserves compared to the areas outside of reserve boundaries (<i>e.g.<\/i>, West Bay reserve: <a href=\"#F4\">Figure 4<\/a>). Measured sound pressures in the low frequency band increased by 5\u201310\u00a0dB over the drifter approach to reef structure, and SPLs in the high frequency band reached 15\u201330\u00a0dB higher during transit within reserve boundaries. The most consistent and detectable sounds forming the daytime oyster reef soundscapes were impulsive broadband signals of snapping shrimp and reef fish vocalizations (<i>e.g.<\/i>, toadfish; <a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"xref22\">Lillis et al., 2014a<\/a>).<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F4\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/d929d697-d328-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/excepturi_deleniti_error_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/d929d697-d328-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/excepturi_deleniti_error_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/d929d697-d328-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JEA-00017-2017-02_F0004.tif\" download=\"JEA-00017-2017-02_F0004.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 4 - Map of drift at West Bay reserve, crossing the majority of the reef structured area, with time series of sound pressure level for the lower (100\u22122,000\u00a0Hz) and (2,000\u221223,000\u00a0Hz) frequency bands and corresponding spectrograms, for three consecutive drifts (b\u2013d).<\/p><div class=\"fig-description\"><i>Hashed lines show time at which a drifter entered and exited reserve boundaries.

Replicate drifts at single reserve sites further demonstrate considerable within-habitat variation. The dependence of the acoustic characteristics on the individual drift path is evident by comparing drifter measurements from multiple drifts conducted at single sites; three consecutive drift measurements at West Bay reserve crossed different areas of the oyster reserve, and the magnitude and duration of the reef-associated sound pressure levels varied according to the trajectory of the particular drift (<a href=\"#F4\">Figure 4<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm45071172062176\">Sets of simultaneous drifts were conducted at the Ocracoke reserve site (<a href=\"#F5\">Figure 5<\/a>), crossing different areas of the reserve and collecting concurrent data that provide additional evidence that the acoustic patterns measured relate to spatial heterogeneity in benthic habitat. Consistent with drift results from other sites, sound levels in the reef-associated upper frequency band increased upon approach to the reserve and a peak sound pressure level was detected above the locations of reef structure in the upper frequency band.

The acoustic variation measured via the drifting hydrophone approach both informs hypotheses regarding the spatial variation and propagation of reef soundscape cues, and also provides important knowledge for future applications of passive acoustics to monitor coastal and estuarine marine reserves. In both the Pamlico Sound estuarine system and the St. John tropical coastal system, drifting hydrophones expanded upon previous results showing differences in sound levels and frequency composition between reef areas and adjacent off-reef habitats. The high spatial resolution acoustic data provided by these studies not only confirmed that a snapping-shrimp dominated frequency range generally defined the soundscapes of reef environments, but showed how closely the peaks in sound levels (particularly in higher frequency bands) correspond to the presence of benthic reef structure over surprisingly small scales. Drifter measurements demonstrated that the method was particularly useful to detect subtle soundscape changes (acoustic gradients and hotspots of fish bioacoustic behavior) within reefs, or where there are many adjacent benthic habitat types. By carrying out these drifter deployments, more sites could be visited and compared, and sampled at higher spatial resolution than in stationary sampling methods (<i>e.g.<\/i>, <a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"xref22\">Lillis et al., 2014a<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"xref18\">Kaplan et al., 2015<\/a>), and this greatly increased the knowledge of the range of variation in soundscape characteristics among and within reefs. The drifter datasets augmented the longer-term acoustic sampling program where a single stationary hydrophone is used to represent the overall soundscape of a given reef site.<\/p><p id=\"idm45071172181456\">Examples from several sites and specific drifts reveal substantial variation at relatively small scales and serve to highlight the utility of the drifter approach in generating ecologically significant acoustic data for use in soundscape ecology and in illuminating reef patterns in general. For example, the drifts across coral habitats in Lameshur Bay point to specific locations within the reefs (\u201cacoustic hotspots\u201d) that may warrant further investigation. The finding that drifter acoustic measurements can be used to detect reef fish vocalizations across the reefs further illustrates its potential use as a method to provide a snapshot of within-reef fish presence and activity, and to identify potential variation in benthic fish communities, complementary to conventional visual sampling methods. More broadly, these surveys could help identify areas that potentially warrant further protection. For example, as many fish sounds are associated with vital behaviors such as reproduction and spawning, detecting areas with greater acoustic activity could facilitate specific management such as no-fishing zones or closures to diving. This mobile observation method enabled such observations in a relatively rapid manner. It is important to note that our drifter deployments were all conducted during daylight hours, however, many soniferous animals are known to exhibit crepuscular and nighttime chorusing (<a href=\"#fn38\" id=\"xref38\">Radford et al., 2008<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn42\" id=\"xref42\">Ricci et al., 2016<\/a>). Future drifter deployments that occur during crepuscular periods and in darkness will further advance assessments of soundscape variability in relation to ecological processes.<\/p><p id=\"idm45071172179168\">Because a broader context of these works was to understand the role of the soundscape for passively drifting planktonic organisms being transported through the estuarine system, the dynamic measurements of soundscape variation at multiple spatial and temporal scales provided especially insightful information from the larval perspective. Combined with longer stationary recordings and experimental data, the drifter measurements were instrumental to the development of a conceptual model of larval settlement in response to sound, to assess the feasibility of sound as a settlement cue based on the spatiotemporal scales of acoustic cues and animal responses (<a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"xref23\">Lillis et al., 2014b<\/a>). Given that many organisms of interest to other soundscape ecologists and marine bioacousticians are also mobile (<i>e.g.<\/i>, fish, mammals, larval forms), this dynamic approach gives insight into the soundscape variation these mobile creatures could experience.<\/p><p id=\"idm45071172678656\">The results presented also indicate that conventional hydrophone measurements are unlikely to capture relevant small-scale (<i>i.e.<\/i>, tens of meters) variation present in many heterogeneous coastal and estuarine systems, where habitats typically form a patchwork of benthic environments, or a habitat-type may vary greatly in its composition within an area. Studies of habitat soundscapes often use few hydrophones and relatively short (<i>e.g.<\/i>, minutes) recordings to represent an entire reef or habitat-type \u2014 a practice that warrants further investigation in light of the potential small-scale variation revealed in our higher-resolution drifter data. These datasets indicate that sound levels and frequency composition can differ substantially over only tens of meters, an important consideration for soundscape studies where recordings are typically made from a recording unit stationed 20\u201350\u00a0m from the target habitat. To prevent mis-characterizing the acoustics of a site, initial investigations of a given study area using drifting hydrophones would help assess the small-scale spatial variation and determine the need for within site replication and the appropriate placement of stationary hydrophones. By using multiple drogues, a high number of simultaneous and consecutive deployments can be carried out at a site to rapidly generate high-resolution soundscape data. Drifter-captured soundscape measurements also revealed important small-scale anthropogenic sources (<i>e.g.<\/i>, buoy chains) that could go undetected or be a considerable artifact, depending on placement of a stationary hydrophone.<\/p><p id=\"idm45071172699712\">The drifters and deployments described herein were tailored to our particular focus on habitat-related soundscapes as a larval fish and invertebrate settlement cue, however, the results demonstrate great potential for drifter use in obtaining fine-scale measurements that could fit numerous applications. To collect ecologically meaningful soundscape data, hydrophones and recorders can also be attached to existing surface drifters or other devices already made to measure animal behaviors (<i>e.g.<\/i>, <a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"xref16\">Irisson et al., 2009<\/a>). In high sea-state environments, it may be necessary to further decouple the hydrophone from the surface float using bungee material (<i>e.g.<\/i>, <a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"xref17\">Kaplan and Mooney, 2016<\/a>) or in deeper water locations a buoyancy controlled subsurface float may be used as a drifter platform (<i>e.g.<\/i>, <a href=\"#fn48\" id=\"xref48\">Simons et al., 2009<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"xref27\">Matsumoto et al., 2013<\/a>). Overall, the success of these initial drifter soundscape surveys should encourage the development and application of this type of approach to enhance stationary soundscape measurements and to investigate the spatiotemporal variation in soundscapes patterns that may be relevant to important ecological processes such as recruitment and habitat complexity.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div id=\"article-back\" class=\"back\"><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45071173339760\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Competing interests<\/h3><p id=\"idm45071172480240\">All authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.<\/p><\/div><h3 class=\"main-title\">Funding sources<\/h3><p>National Science Foundation, USA, Grants OCE-1234688 to DBE and DRB, ISO-1210292 to AL, DBE and DRB, OCE-1536782 to TAM and JKL, and funding to AL from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\u2019s Interdisciplinary Award and Postdoctoral Scholar Programs.<\/p><div class=\"back-section\"><h3 class=\"main-title\">References<\/h3><div class=\"reference-container\" id=\"fn1\"><div><div class=\"ref-content\"><strong>Au W.

This article questions this unforeseen success and investigates the development of the Armenians\u2019 commercial network before their being pursued and deported by the Safavid monarchs in the 16th and 17th centuries. It surveys the scattering of Armenians in West Asia from the beginning of the mediaeval period. Although the majority of old sources do not refer to the Armenians\u2019 involvement in trade before the 16th century, they refer to their geographical presence and discuss their political association with various rulers and communities in West Asia. By puzzling out the Armenians ties with various people and regions and following their trek from the Byzantine times to the Ottoman and Safavid era, this article extracts the keystone to the Armenians\u2019 ascendancy in the history of world trade.<\/p><\/div>\n",

By contrast, the manner of their financial ascent is enigmatic. Though the relative abundance of primary sources from the Safavid period has made information on Armenian world trade and the presence of Armenians in European\u2014and to some extent in Indian\u2014markets very accessible, the Armenian network to which scholars have referred has not been well investigated. How was this network created? How long was it in gestation? Indeed, there may be several reasons behind the rise of this network. This article offers an account of the phenomenon by looking at the geographical dispersal of the Armenians in the centuries which preceded their association with the Safavid court.<\/p><p id=\"idm139848954723744\">History sometimes astonishes us with unexpected episodes, and one of these is surely the emergence of close relations between Christian Armenian merchants and the Muslim Shiite kings of the 17th-century Iran. This mutually beneficial relationship began when the Safavid Shah Abbas I (1587\u20131629) deported Armenians from the Caucasus to different parts of Iran (especially from Julfa to Isfahan)<sup id=\"xref1\"><a href=\"#fn1\">1<\/a><\/sup> and granted them protections of various kinds. Never before, as far as is known, had Armenian merchants received the support of such a powerful and ambitious monarch. Abbas\u2019 motivation was to gain financially from entrusting the Armenians with the export of Iran\u2019s most lucrative commodity of the age\u2014silk.<sup id=\"xref2\"><a href=\"#fn2\">2<\/a><\/sup> Though Armenians had been present on Iranian soil since remote antiquity,<sup id=\"xref3\"><a href=\"#fn3\">3<\/a><\/sup> before the 17th century, references to them are sporadic, and mostly concentrated in accounts of Persian expeditions to Armenia.<sup id=\"xref4\"><a href=\"#fn4\">4<\/a><\/sup> Unsurprisingly, the Shah\u2019s intervention gave massive impetus to Armenian commerce, and the Armenians went from strength to strength, amassing huge wealth and establishing a trade network so vast that it seized the attention of contemporary European travellers. In consequence, after 1604, references to Armenians increase substantially in non-Armenian sources, especially in relation to trade between Iran and the rest of the World.<sup id=\"xref5\"><a href=\"#fn5\">5<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954732016\">According to a widespread consensus, Shah Abbas\u2019 interest in the Armenians was triggered by their established reputation in trade, and their having a wide and successful commercial network.<sup id=\"xref6\"><a href=\"#fn6\">6<\/a><\/sup> But what remains enigmatic in this famous chapter of Armenian and Iranian history is how the Armenians rose in the first place to a position where they attracted the attention of the Shah, thereby catalysing their further meteoric ascent. The origins of the network which rendered them appealing to the rulers of Iran remain obscure; yet, the centuries preceding the Safavid period (1501\u20131722) harbour many clues about the phenomenal ascendance of Armenians in the silk trade.<\/p><p id=\"idm139848954727776\">As Sebouh Aslanian has rightly remarked, the Armenian diaspora did not originate for trade motives.<sup id=\"xref7\"><a href=\"#fn7\">7<\/a><\/sup> It was shaped by historical factors such as deportations and displacement. So far, little attention has been devoted to these factors. Such will be the aim of this article. It will examine key events from the onset of the mediaeval period to the reign of Shah Abbas I which enabled the Armenians to play an important role in the world trade during the modern period. The geographical remit of the first six divisions of this article will be the West Asian territories, where successive conquests from the 7th to the 16th centuries resulted in the dispersal of the Armenians into territories dominated by the Muslims, and their increasing participation in the politics and economy of the region. The final sections will discuss the expansion of Armenian settlements beyond their historical boundaries, leading to the transformation of the Armenian diaspora from a successful West Asian people to a wounded global community.<\/p><p id=\"idm139848954728784\">As we shall see, the network was initiated well before Shah Abbas\u2019 access to the throne, and the key lies not in Iran but rather in the Ottoman and Byzantine Empires. Even though the commercial success of the Armenians in the 16th century and beyond was due to the development of transport infrastructure and administration within Persia, India and the Ottoman Empire, the premise was the high degree of mobility that took a millennium to build since the Armenians had been scattered in the frontier lands of massive Empires.<\/p><p id=\"idm139848954729200\">Although Abu-Lughod has overlooked the Armenians\u2019 activities, she depicts the mediaeval worldwide trade network as the harbinger of contemporary international trade<sup id=\"xref8\"><a href=\"#fn8\">8<\/a><\/sup> and alludes to the importance of the Armenian territories on the Mediterranean for the expansion of European trade with more distant Asian territories.<sup id=\"xref9\"><a href=\"#fn9\">9<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954730912\">The discussion presented here does not contradict Aslanian\u2019s or Baghdiantz\u2019s theories that the Armenian trade took off in the 16th century,<sup id=\"xref10\"><a href=\"#fn10\">10<\/a><\/sup> it only establishes the fact that the network facilitating Armenian trade had been in germination since the Byzantine period and came to fruition in the Ottoman era. Therefore, with or without Julfa\u2019s rise, the Armenians were ideally placed to rise as leaders in trade once the commercial opportunities increased in the 16th century. Bursa, Aleppo, Caffa<sup id=\"xref11\"><a href=\"#fn11\">11<\/a><\/sup> and Smyrna were ports of access to Europe,<sup id=\"xref12\"><a href=\"#fn12\">12<\/a><\/sup> in which there was an Armenian presence well before the Armenians\u2019 domination of the silk trade.<\/p><p id=\"idm139848954735168\">The article\u2019s findings may be relevant to more recent history, as they shed light on the Armenians\u2019 failure to sustain their commercial network after the 19th century\u2014an important topic which in modern historiography has been eclipsed by the Genocide.<\/p><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139848954734640\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">The Armenian trade network in the 16th century<\/h3><p id=\"idm139848954736080\">Let us begin by surveying the Armenians\u2019 16th-century trade network, which so appealed to Shah Abbas I. What was the geographic span of Armenian trade, and who did the Armenians deal with?<\/p><p id=\"idm139848954736608\">Not long before the 16th century, European travellers had sporadically come across Armenian merchants in Tabriz (North of Iran), Samarqand (Central Asia) and Hormuz (Persian Gulf).<sup id=\"xref13\"><a href=\"#fn13\">13<\/a><\/sup> However, it seems that before the Safavid era (1501\u20131722), the Armenians\u2019 economic sphere of activities was not very noticeable.<\/p><p id=\"idm139848954737840\">In particular, 15th-century Armenian merchants were not prominent in the European silk trade. This had taken off in Europe around the 14th century when the ancient Silk Road running between China and the Mediterranean had declined after the collapse of the Mongol Empire. Before 1500, the European silk trade was principally run by Italian merchants, who had established trade posts throughout the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea litoral.<sup id=\"xref14\"><a href=\"#fn14\">14<\/a><\/sup> Despite encountering strong Armenian presences in several areas they dealt with, the Italian merchants seem not to have been bothered by Armenian competitors. Trading in Bursa between 1487 and 1500, Italians only report dealing with Azemi Iranians.<sup id=\"xref15\"><a href=\"#fn15\">15<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954740384\">But, even if in the late 15th century the Armenians were not yet competing with European and Asian merchants on the intercontinental scene, they had colonies in areas which were turning into trade hubs. Their uninterrupted presence stretching from the Eastern Mediterranean coasts of Egypt, the Levant and Anatolia all the way to the Caspian Sea and the Iranian Plateau proved to be a strong asset for Armenian trade network building.<\/p><p id=\"idm139848954740224\">Aleppo, which was close to important Armenian colonies in the Levant and a major market for the silk trade, had already attracted Armenian merchants from the Caucasus in the early 16th century.<sup id=\"xref16\"><a href=\"#fn16\">16<\/a><\/sup> Sure enough, by 1566, Armenian merchants had taken over the lucrative trades in Iran to the extent that an English merchant by the name of Arthur Edwards complained that it was very difficult to compete with them (and the Venetians).<sup id=\"xref17\"><a href=\"#fn17\">17<\/a><\/sup> Here, we see glimmers of the Armenians exploiting their network to its full potential. These are manifestations with a long history, and to unpick it, we need to review a few chapters of the Armenians\u2019 history, beginning in antiquity. This will enable us to observe the network as it was constituted.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139848954742832\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">The diffusion of Armenian communities<\/h3><p id=\"idm139848954744256\">When in the 6th century the Byzantine Emperor Maurice deported Armenians to remote areas and advised the Persian kings to do the same,<sup id=\"xref18\"><a href=\"#fn18\">18<\/a><\/sup> he was oblivious to the fact that he and his rivals were setting the stage for a future global network.<\/p><p id=\"idm139848954746000\">A crucial factor in the Armenians\u2019 success as traders, arguably even a precondition for it, was the existence of Armenian communities in a string of neighbouring regions throughout Western Asia and the Mediterranean. This phenomenon, largely caused by forcible deportation, has a history dating back to antiquity.<\/p><p id=\"idm139848954745456\">Armenian territories were, throughout history, always overrun by one or other of the most powerful empires of the era, generating commercial opportunities across vast territories for the Armenians. Evidently, the Armenians were not a wandering nation from the outset, and it is quite important to note the geographical location of Armenia in order to understand its significance for ancient, mediaeval and modern neighbouring empires (<a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1<\/a>).<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F1\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/dafd6a3a-c020-11e6-a8a2-0242ac110002\/consequatur_voluptatem_porro_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/dafd6a3a-c020-11e6-a8a2-0242ac110002\/consequatur_voluptatem_porro_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/dafd6a3a-c020-11e6-a8a2-0242ac110002\/CJES-00022-2016-03_F0001.jpg\" download=\"CJES-00022-2016-03_F0001.jpg\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 1<\/p><div class=\"fig-description\"><i>Location of historical Armenia.<\/i><\/div><\/div><\/div><p id=\"idm139848954745840\">The true delineation of historic Armenia is a complicated matter, as the ancient kingdom only enjoyed brief periods of independence, and its borders fluctuated rapidly as determined by wars with neighbouring powers.<sup id=\"xref19\"><a href=\"#fn19\">19<\/a><\/sup> However, most would agree that the Armenian homeland was based in the mountainous southern Caucasus, confined between the Araxes River in the south, the Greater Caucasus Range to the North, the valleys of the Kur River to the East and the Black Sea to the West.<sup id=\"xref20\"><a href=\"#fn20\">20<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954747408\">Not only is Armenia historically situated at a critical trade route linking Europe and West Asia, strategically but also it is the gateway to the vast prosperous lands of the Iranian Plateau and Mesopotamia. As a result of its geographical location, Armenia was the object of contention between the rulers of Anatolia and the masters of the Iranian Plateau, and from the 13th century onwards, was coveted by more rival conquerors from the Volga-Caspian steppes to the north. First, in classical antiquity, it was Rome and Parthia that disputed it; later, it was Byzantium and Persia. In the mediaeval period, Armenia was first divided by the Byzantine and the Arab empires, before it was engulfed in the Mongol empire. Finally, in the modern era, it was disputed between the Ottoman and Persian empires, with which Russia began competing towards the close of the 18th century. As a constant bone of contention, Armenia was exposed to regular military incursions and deportations. The forced migrations prompted the establishment of Armenian settlements in new geographical areas, and each conflict enforced new ties between Armenian leaders and the rulers of rival empires. These political ties allowed the Armenians to benefit from trade advantages over vast territories.<\/p><p id=\"idm139848954760752\">In antiquity, neither the neighbouring Iranian princes to the south-east nor the Greco-Roman rulers from Europe could manage to control Armenia for long periods, and ultimately they had to share power in the region.<sup id=\"xref21\"><a href=\"#fn21\">21<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954797280\">The conversion of Armenians and Byzantine Greeks to Christianity did not generate political and religious unity between these two nations.<sup id=\"xref22\"><a href=\"#fn22\">22<\/a><\/sup> After the Council of Chalcedon (AD 451), the Armenian and Greek Churches became estranged over theological matters, and thereafter the Armenian leaders shifted allegiances between the Persian Sasanians and the Byzantines according to their own political agenda.<sup id=\"xref23\"><a href=\"#fn23\">23<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954862144\">This political oscillation between two rival powers enabled the Armenians to establish close links with the Persians and the Greeks.<sup id=\"xref24\"><a href=\"#fn24\">24<\/a><\/sup> Indeed, despite its adherence to Christianity, Armenia maintained strong cultural ties with Persia until the Arab conquests. Most of the Armenian lands remained within the Persian sphere of influence, and Armenian princes were summoned regularly and in great numbers to the Sasanian court in Ctesiphon.<sup id=\"xref25\"><a href=\"#fn25\">25<\/a><\/sup> As a result, the Armenian economy was well integrated into both the Byzantine and Persian economic systems, which is even substantiated by the Armenians\u2019 equal use of both Byzantine and Persian measurement units.<sup id=\"xref26\"><a href=\"#fn26\">26<\/a><\/sup><\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139848954945168\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Between Byzantium and the Arabs<\/h3><p id=\"idm139848954979376\">After the elimination of the Persian Empire by Muslim Arabs between 634 and 651, Byzantium wielded even more power over Armenia.<sup id=\"xref27\"><a href=\"#fn27\">27<\/a><\/sup> There were more than 40 Byzantine emperors of Armenian descent, and many high-ranking Armenians appeared in the Byzantine army and administration.<sup id=\"xref28\"><a href=\"#fn28\">28<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848955304016\">At the same time, Armenian territories were contended over by the Arabs and Byzantium. The Arabs saw the Armenians as a shield against the Greek Byzantines, while the Byzantines regarded the Armenians as their vassals.<sup id=\"xref29\"><a href=\"#fn29\">29<\/a><\/sup> The Armenians were divided in their loyalties, sometimes to the point of infighting.<sup id=\"xref30\"><a href=\"#fn30\">30<\/a><\/sup> The pro-establishment Bagratuni (and earlier Rshtunis) and pro-Byzantine Mamikonean clans generally stood against each other.<sup id=\"xref31\"><a href=\"#fn31\">31<\/a><\/sup> Since the Arabs were not able to eradicate the Byzantine Empire, a frontier zone was created in which Armenian territories became a battlefield.<sup id=\"xref32\"><a href=\"#fn32\">32<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954801136\">The fact that many of its members were pro-Byzantine meant that the Arabs could not trust the Armenian nobility. After conquering Armenian territories from the Persians and the Byzantines, the Arabs preferred instead to deal with the Armenian clergy, who saw no advantage in Byzantine rule since their theological views were antagonistic.<sup id=\"xref33\"><a href=\"#fn33\">33<\/a><\/sup> Some members of the Church seem to have at least a basic knowledge of Arabic\u2014the Catholicos Hovhannes Odznets\u2019i (f. 717\u2013728) negotiated better conditions for the Christian communities with the Caliph Umar II (717\u2013720).<sup id=\"xref34\"><a href=\"#fn34\">34<\/a><\/sup> Nonetheless, despite Arab rule and the Armenian priests\u2019 efforts to learn Arabic, Byzantine cultural influence continued to dominate the Armenian Church and consequently Armenian politics.<sup id=\"xref35\"><a href=\"#fn35\">35<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954835824\">Perhaps due to the mountainous features of the Caucasus, which occasionally protected the Armenians, along with the Armenians\u2019 historical and cultural attachment to this mountainous region, and their distinct religious and ethnic identity, the Armenians were sporadically able to recover their independence, even after long periods of subordination. Just as in 1991, when an Armenian state was regenerated after many centuries of Ottoman and Russian rule, an Armenian state was re-established by Ashot of the Bagratuni dynasty in 884.<sup id=\"xref36\"><a href=\"#fn36\">36<\/a><\/sup> The Byzantines and the Arabs conferred on him the title of prince of princes, while it seems he received the title of king from the Caliph al-Mu\u2019tamid (r. 870\u2013892).<sup id=\"xref37\"><a href=\"#fn37\">37<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954857856\">In the long term, the autonomy of the Armenian territories claimed by both Arabs and Byzantines enabled the Armenians to avoid assimilation and allowed them to develop their economic and political networks in West Asia among the competing powers of the Byzantine Empire and the Caliphate. In defending his rapprochement with the Byzantine Emperor Leo VI (886\u2013912), the Armenian King Smbat I \u2018the Martyr\u2019 (890\u2013914) actually referred to the economic benefits of political relationships with the Muslim rulers during the reign of Caliph al-Mu\u2019tadid (892\u2013902).<sup id=\"xref38\"><a href=\"#fn38\">38<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954898096\">Soon after, the tide turned against the Muslims. As the Arabs withdrew from Anatolia in the mid-10th century, the Byzantines began their campaigns in Anatolia and Syria. Despite their success in the region, the Byzantines were conscious of the potential for Muslim retaliation and established buffer principalities where they resettled Armenian populations.<sup id=\"xref39\"><a href=\"#fn39\">39<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954752816\">A further reason for deportation was that the political instability in the borderlands generated an atmosphere favourable for sedition. The Byzantine emperors occasionally deported Armenians to their capital or their European territories, because they either shared their religious views or wished to quench Armenian rebellions.<sup id=\"xref40\"><a href=\"#fn40\">40<\/a><\/sup> The Byzantine emperor John I Tzimiskes (r. 969\u2013976), who was also of Armenian descent, played an important role in spreading Armenians in the area and in asserting his hegemony over Armenia. He regarded the Armenian regent, Ashot III (r. 952\u2013977), as his vassal,<sup id=\"xref41\"><a href=\"#fn41\">41<\/a><\/sup> while Ashot had won the favour of the Caliph for fighting his Muslim enemies.<sup id=\"xref42\"><a href=\"#fn42\">42<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954829056\">According to Michel the Syrian, the deportations and migrations had generated an Armenian presence in the European territories of the Byzantine Empire beyond Constantinople, in Asia Minor and throughout the Levant and Egypt.<sup id=\"xref43\"><a href=\"#fn43\">43<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954754624\">Syria in the 10th and 11th centuries was at the crossroads between the Byzantine Empire, Fatimid Egypt and the Buwayhids of Iraq. The competition between the three regions benefited the urban dwellers of Syria, as trade was revived along the coastal areas.<sup id=\"xref44\"><a href=\"#fn44\">44<\/a><\/sup> Since the Armenians were present in the three regions, they were in a good position to establish their network and obtain key positions in the Levant. Tripoli in the Levant at the end of the 10th century had an Armenian governor (a Muslim Armenian).<sup id=\"xref45\"><a href=\"#fn45\">45<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954759456\">Thanks to their presence and their growing network throughout the Levant and Mesopotamia, the Armenians were able to build a reputation for themselves in the hallmark industries of the 10th and 11th centuries, namely, textile weaving and silk production.<sup id=\"xref46\"><a href=\"#fn46\">46<\/a><\/sup><\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139848954765584\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">The Hegemony of the Seljuk Turks: The beginning of a long-lasting challenge<\/h3><p id=\"idm139848954770688\">In the course of the 10th century, Arab rule in the Middle East declined and was replaced by the emerging power of southeastern Turkic people, the new enemies of Byzantium.<\/p><p id=\"idm139848954772144\">According to Kirakos of Gandzak, the arrival of the Seljuk Turks prompted many Armenians to move to Cilicia. Michael the Syrian reports that the Byzantine emperors (mainly Basil II r. 976\u20131025) encouraged the Armenian migration towards Syria and gave Armenians authority over Cilicia, in order to create further obstacles for the Turks.<sup id=\"xref47\"><a href=\"#fn47\">47<\/a><\/sup> The control of a few Mediterranean ports sowed the seeds of Italo-Armenian trade for the later centuries.<\/p><p id=\"idm139848954778144\">The Battle of Manzikert (1071) gave the upper hand to the Seljuk Turks, who took over lands populated by the Armenians.<sup id=\"xref48\"><a href=\"#fn48\">48<\/a><\/sup> The Greek population disappeared from the area, while the Armenians remained scattered, particularly in the mountainous areas. The survival of Hemshen, or Muslim Armenians, along the southern coasts of the Black Sea till very recently corroborates the dissemination of the Armenian population from the Caucasus to deeper Anatolia, after their deportation by the Byzantines and perhaps later by the Seljuks.<sup id=\"xref49\"><a href=\"#fn49\">49<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954788512\">The Seljuks continued the Byzantine policies of repopulating deserted areas with Armenians in order to revive the economy of the newly acquired territories. Large numbers of Armenians were resettled between the Euphrates and the Mediterranean Sea.<sup id=\"xref50\"><a href=\"#fn50\">50<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954791728\">As under the Byzantines, the Armenians distinguished themselves in politics and in the army.

The Caliph al-Muntasir (1036\u20131094) resorted to him to restore order (and probably his power) in Egypt. Badr al-Jamali\u2019s move to Egypt not only created Armenian military contingents in Egypt but also reinforced the Armenian presence there.<sup id=\"xref59\"><a href=\"#fn59\">59<\/a><\/sup> He secured the position of vizier for his son and enrolled Armenian architects and artisans from Syria.<sup id=\"xref60\"><a href=\"#fn60\">60<\/a><\/sup> The Armenians had become so powerful under the Fatimids of Egypt that by 1130, the brother of the Armenian Catholicos became vizier for a short period without even renouncing Christianity.

Their multiple alliances with Crusaders and Muslims along with their geographical dispersion in crossroads between Europe, Asia and Africa, along with their political network, put the Armenians in advantage, particularly in the commercial sphere.<\/p><p id=\"idm139848954843200\">By the 13th century, the rise of Venice and Genoa as commercial and military powers was concurrent with the spread of Armenians in the Eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea areas where both Italian states had established trading posts. The sack of Constantinople during the 4th Crusade (1204) further benefited the coastal cities of the Levant where Cilician Armenia had just been established. With already a small presence in Venice, the Armenians were able to build stronger commercial ties with the Venetians, who were keen to control the commercial hubs of the Levant and the Aegean Sea.<sup id=\"xref62\"><a href=\"#fn62\">62<\/a><\/sup><\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139848954850192\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">A calamity with silver lining: The Mongol outburst and new opportunities for Armenians<\/h3><p id=\"idm139848954852768\">At the eve of the Mongol conquests in the 13th century, the Armenians occupied prominent positions in Muslim territories and in the Byzantine Empire. They ruled the small Cilician kingdom in Southern Anatolia at the edge of the Mediterranean. Even in Georgia, Armenian noble families had accumulated power by intermarrying with both Georgian magnates and Seljuk rulers.<sup id=\"xref63\"><a href=\"#fn63\">63<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954854848\">Caucasian Armenia was one of the first territories to be conquered by the Mongols before their descent into Western Asia. They enrolled many Armenians in their army before conquering Anatolia and Mesopotamia.<sup id=\"xref64\"><a href=\"#fn64\">64<\/a><\/sup> The prince Avag son of Ivan\u00e9 was one of the first to negotiate with the Mongols upon their arrival in the 1220s. Kirakos of Gandzak mentions that he was sent to the Great Khan in Mongolia even before the famous king Het\u2019um.<sup id=\"xref65\"><a href=\"#fn65\">65<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954876272\">The economy of Caucasian Armenia, like that of the rest of West Asia, was initially affected by the Mongol incursions, but the Armenian traders seem to have recovered shortly after. Two factors in particular benefited the Armenians under the Mongol rule. One was the shift of the centre of power from Mesopotamia to the vicinity of Caucasian Armenia in West Asia,<sup id=\"xref66\"><a href=\"#fn66\">66<\/a><\/sup> and the other was the establishment of the Armenian kingdom of Cilicia shortly before the arrival of the Mongols. These changes generated further political opportunities for the Armenians.<\/p><p id=\"idm139848954903088\">The Cilician Armenians who had begun interacting with European merchants, pilgrims and crusaders since the time of Leon II (1150\u20131219),<sup id=\"xref67\"><a href=\"#fn67\">67<\/a><\/sup> supported the Mongols in their undertakings in the region. Western Armenians in particular became Mongol agents.<sup id=\"xref68\"><a href=\"#fn68\">68<\/a><\/sup> They were good assets for the Mongols due to their links with the various different European groups mentioned above. Armenians travelled to Mongol headquarters in the Far East in order to gain some leverage with the rulers and strengthen their network. King Het\u2019um I of Cilicia was quick to submit to the Mongols and negotiate with their commander Baiju. For further consolidating his ties, he sent his brother Smbat <i>Sparapet<\/i> (supreme commander of the Armenian armed forces) to meet the Great Khan (G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan) in Karakorum in 1247,<sup id=\"xref69\"><a href=\"#fn69\">69<\/a><\/sup> who once there married a Mongol princess. Het\u2019um I himself visited Karakorum in 1251, and possibly in 1254.<sup id=\"xref70\"><a href=\"#fn70\">70<\/a><\/sup> He negotiated with Manku (M\u00f6ngke) Khan privileges for Armenians, reducing their tax burden.<\/p><p id=\"idm139848954924192\">The Mongols\u2019 appointment of Armenian governors in Northern Mesopotamia at the end of the 13th century confirms the success of the Armenian negotiations and also the importance of the presence of Armenian communities in the areas of Mosul, Mardin, Amid (Diyarbakir) and Mush.<sup id=\"xref71\"><a href=\"#fn71\">71<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954934160\">Since the Mongols could not advance beyond Syria, the Armenian population was once again split between two antagonistic zones: the Mamluks on the Mediterranean coasts and the Mongols in the East. Their involvement with the Mamluks of Egypt enabled King Het\u2019um to act as an intermediary between them and the Mongols.<sup id=\"xref72\"><a href=\"#fn72\">72<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954935744\">Cilician Armenians maintained alliances with the Latin world, and the port of Ayas\/Lajazzo turned into a Mediterranean trade centre drawing Venetian merchants. All sorts of merchandise were being exchanged, attracting traders from Greece, Egypt, Syria and Anatolia.<sup id=\"xref73\"><a href=\"#fn73\">73<\/a><\/sup> The Venetians had leverage over the Armenians in this period. Ayas would have lost its importance had Het\u2019um\u2019s son Lewon II (1269\u20131289) not increased the privileges of the Venetian merchants owing to the turmoil in Mongol territories.<sup id=\"xref74\"><a href=\"#fn74\">74<\/a><\/sup> After the fall of the Latin principalities in the Levant, Cilicia remained the major point of trade between Europe and Asia.<sup id=\"xref75\"><a href=\"#fn75\">75<\/a><\/sup> While attracting Italian merchants, many Armenians settled in Italy, establishing little Armenian colonies in the major port cities and Rome.<sup id=\"xref76\"><a href=\"#fn76\">76<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954984416\">The Mongols afforded the Armenian caravans protection, as they benefited from their commerce. Armenian trade connected Cilicia to the Caucasus and north-western Iran, mainly Tabriz, which had become one of the main centres of Mongol government.<sup id=\"xref77\"><a href=\"#fn77\">77<\/a><\/sup> Even outside Mongol territories in Anatolia, the Armenians had succeeded in obtaining the protection of some Turkic rulers, obliging the Italian merchants to honour their trade agreements with them.<sup id=\"xref78\"><a href=\"#fn78\">78<\/a><\/sup> The Venetians took advantage of the Armenian influence and network, which survived the fall of the Mongols, to expand their trade in the Caucasus using the routes of Trebizond and Tabriz where the Armenians had a presence.<sup id=\"xref79\"><a href=\"#fn79\">79<\/a><\/sup> They used the services of Armenian translators and also paid a percentage to the Armenians who facilitated their business in the regions between the Black Sea and Tabriz. Further north in the Crimea, the Armenians had built strong ties with the Genoese merchants. An entire quarter in Caffa on the Black Sea was known to have been occupied by Armenians. The Genoese, who prevailed over the Venetians in the Black Sea trade, had to content themselves with carrying their commerce in the Levant through the second main port of Cilicia, Corycos, mainly due to the Venetians\u2019 sway over the bigger port city of Ayas.<sup id=\"xref80\"><a href=\"#fn80\">80<\/a><\/sup> In effect, the Italians had to begin competing with each other for winning the Armenians\u2019 partnership in trade even before the Safavid era.<\/p><p id=\"idm139848954953360\">The prosperity of Armenian merchants in this period and their interaction with Italians testify to their integration in the East Mediterranean and Black Sea regions\u2019 economies.<sup id=\"xref81\"><a href=\"#fn81\">81<\/a><\/sup> In Cilicia, they remained the principal trade partners of Italian merchants even after the fall of the region into the hands of the Mamluks. Thereafter they lost their Ambassadors in Venice, but their numbers increased, as the sources testify to their presence in a number of the Republic\u2019s districts.<sup id=\"xref82\"><a href=\"#fn82\">82<\/a><\/sup><\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139848954928144\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Timur and the push into Europe<\/h3><p id=\"idm139848954947888\">Timur\u2019s invasion of the Caucasus and West Asia after 1386 was no doubt disastrous in terms of human losses.<sup id=\"xref83\"><a href=\"#fn83\">83<\/a><\/sup> Christian minorities in particular suffered from his onslaughts in Mesopotamia.

As a matter of policy, Timur seems to have been favourably disposed towards the merchant class. He drastically improved the travel infrastructure in Transoxiana where he had established his central council.<sup id=\"xref86\"><a href=\"#fn86\">86<\/a><\/sup> Timur and his successors set measures to improve the traffic infrastructure by building trading houses, hospices, bridges and restoring safety on the roads in order to enhance links between Europe, India and China.<sup id=\"xref87\"><a href=\"#fn87\">87<\/a><\/sup> The Castilian traveller Ruy Gonz\u00e1lez de Clavijo met Armenians in Samarqand, which had become a major trade centre in the 14th century.<sup id=\"xref88\"><a href=\"#fn88\">88<\/a><\/sup> However, the main centre of Armenian activities remained around the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.<\/p><p id=\"idm139848954874432\">Timur\u2019s invasion had indeed caused many Armenians to move further north and west, establishing an Armenian presence in Poland. As mentioned earlier, wealthy Armenian merchants were already well established in the Crimea in the 14th century, and their trade with the Genoese in the Crimean port of Caffa did not seem to have been hampered by Timurid rule as it continued into the early 1400s.<sup id=\"xref89\"><a href=\"#fn89\">89<\/a><\/sup> According to some Polish sources, Crimea was considered an extension of Greater Armenia due to the number of Armenians coming from the region to the Polish city of Lvov.<sup id=\"xref90\"><a href=\"#fn90\">90<\/a><\/sup> The Armenian population in Lvov increased to such an extent in the 14th century that the construction of an Armenian Cathedral there was financed in 1367 by the wealthy Armenian merchants of Caffa.<sup id=\"xref91\"><a href=\"#fn91\">91<\/a><\/sup> Lvov became a trade hub connecting the Black Sea (Crimea in the north and Trebizond in the south) to the Baltic, bringing together merchants from Europe and Asia.<sup id=\"xref92\"><a href=\"#fn92\">92<\/a><\/sup><\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139848954877168\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">The emergence of commercial hubs<\/h3><p id=\"idm139848954882704\">The Armenian community in Lvov was important enough to be granted its own laws. The Armenian statute was approved by King Sigismund I in 1519,<sup id=\"xref93\"><a href=\"#fn93\">93<\/a><\/sup> which attests to their growing influence and affluence in Lvov due mostly to their success in Eurasian trade.<\/p><p id=\"idm139848954905424\">In the same period, the presence of Armenians was reinforced in Italian commercial hubs, including Rome. The Armenians\u2019 commercial base in the Caucasus, Julfa on the Araxes River, can be located in the first modern atlas produced in Rome around 1570.<sup id=\"xref94\"><a href=\"#fn94\">94<\/a><\/sup> Although the Armenian presence in Syria and the Levant is documented throughout the late mediaeval period (10th\u201315th centuries), their involvement in trade prior to the 16th century has been largely overlooked or treated as marginal by contemporary historians focusing on the Armenians. The general assumption is that the Armenians of Julfa suddenly rose to prominence in the second half of the 16th century for their involvement in the silk trade and were then noticed by Italian traders in Levantine markets such as Aleppo.<sup id=\"xref95\"><a href=\"#fn95\">95<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954946544\">By this time, the Armenians\u2019 notoriety in commerce should not come as a surprise. As we discussed earlier, the Armenians were already settled between the Silk Road and the Mediterranean trade route well before the 16th century and therefore had a privileged position in the emerging Ottoman and Persian empires that spanned the crossroads of these trade routes.<\/p><p id=\"idm139848954985360\">Moreover, the Armenians\u2019 trade network was not limited to Poland, Italy<sup id=\"xref96\"><a href=\"#fn96\">96<\/a><\/sup> and West Asia. In the 16th century, Western travellers reported that they benefited from the Armenians\u2019 connections at the courts of Indian and Burmese kings during their trips in Asia. An Italian traveller who visited Bengal and Burma tells us that these Armenians considered themselves subjects of Central Asian or East Asian Khans, implying that there were Armenians with important trade networks based outside their traditional hubs in the Ottoman and Persian territories. They had probably spread to other parts of Asia during the Mongol rule and established colonies in Central Asia, proceeding southeastward upon the inception of Mughal rule. Additionally, we are also told that they facilitated trade for Persian merchants,<sup id=\"xref97\"><a href=\"#fn97\">97<\/a><\/sup> which attests to the Armenians\u2019 eminent reputation in Iran for overseas trade.<\/p><p id=\"idm139848954760464\">Some early modern sources seem to suggest that the Armenians were involved in the Indian Ocean trade even prior to the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century. Abb\u00e9 Raynal hints that the Armenians began trading in India before the development of Julfa in the second half of the 16th century.<sup id=\"xref98\"><a href=\"#fn98\">98<\/a><\/sup> There are other allusions to Armenian presence in India in the late 15th century and early 16th centuries assembled by Aslanian.<sup id=\"xref99\"><a href=\"#fn99\">99<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954772656\">As early as 1530, Safavid rulers had already ordered the relocation of Armenians to the Iranian Plateau.<sup id=\"xref100\"><a href=\"#fn100\">100<\/a><\/sup> The Ottomans\u2019 competition with the monarchs of Iran for relocating Armenian populations to their own territories signals that the Armenians had already a well-established reputation for their skills. Although the Armenians seem to have reached their zenith in trade under the protection of Safavid monarchs, the historical evidence presented earlier suggests that their trade network had taken many centuries to develop.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm139848954790768\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">The collapse of Safavid Iran and the downfall of the Armenian trade network<\/h3><p id=\"idm139848954795488\">Apart from having a unique language with a distinctive alphabet, and adhering to an autocephalous Christian denomination governed by its own patriarchs and synods,<sup id=\"xref101\"><a href=\"#fn101\">101<\/a><\/sup> the Armenians have a millenary experience of living in diaspora and building networks. Some have wrongly argued that the Armenians\u2019 identity has been strengthened by the Genocide,<sup id=\"xref102\"><a href=\"#fn102\">102<\/a><\/sup> but it is mostly their consciousness of a long history of preservation in alien lands, combined with commercial success and political privileges, that has kept Armenians rallied under the same banner. Hence, the strength of Armenian identity should be sought in their history of political and economic achievements, which has allowed them to survive as a diasporic group.<\/p><p id=\"idm139848954819488\">The story of the Armenians\u2019 Golden Age of Trade seems to have dusked in the 18th century, first because of the political unrests in Iran and second due to the rise of the mercantile maritime powers. By then, they no longer dominated Iranian trade. The Safavid dynasty had collapsed in 1736, and havoc was wrought by the wars conducted by Nadir Shah (1736\u20131747), which rendered trade impractical in Iran and northern India. The royal support of Iranian monarchs, which had given the Armenians leverage over European trade companies in Asia and a bargaining chip to successfully negotiate legal advantages and commercial privileges in Europe, had disappeared.<sup id=\"xref103\"><a href=\"#fn103\">103<\/a><\/sup> Realising the Armenians\u2019 political losses and disapproving of their competition, the British navy began obstructing their commercial operations as early as 1748.<sup id=\"xref104\"><a href=\"#fn104\">104<\/a><\/sup> Numerous Armenian ships were seized in the Indian Ocean under the pretext of war.<sup id=\"xref105\"><a href=\"#fn105\">105<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954851648\">The Armenians\u2019 setback was occurring not only in India and the Indian Ocean but also in Poland. All of their legal privileges, which had been granted as early as the 14th century, were abolished in 1784.<sup id=\"xref106\"><a href=\"#fn106\">106<\/a><\/sup> The collapse of Iran\u2019s economy probably triggered the domino effect, as Iran was the Armenians\u2019 most important trade hub until the 18th century.<\/p><p id=\"idm139848954893696\">Although the Armenians lost ground to more aggressive competing trade networks taking over their commercial routes in the 18th century, Armenian entrepreneurship did not die completely. Despite the loss of their bases and support in Iran, the Armenians were able to extend their years of glory for another century in India and Java, mainly thanks to the wealth they had accumulated under the Safavids. The affluent merchant families, such as the Manoukians, Haroutunians, Zakarians, Petrossians and Shahamirian(ts)s, who continued their trade business in Madras and Java, are a testimony to the Armenians\u2019 vitality in the 18th- and 19th-century Asia.<sup id=\"xref107\"><a href=\"#fn107\">107<\/a><\/sup> Their family roots can be traced back to the Velijanian family who had once built a Eurasian commercial empire from Iran.<sup id=\"xref108\"><a href=\"#fn108\">108<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954894928\">In Istanbul and Tbilisi, Armenians continued to flourish culturally and even economically as the 19th century drew to a close. Since their reputation preceded them in trade, the Armenians were allowed to dominate the oil industry throughout the 19th century after the Russians annexed from Iran the oil-rich regions of the Caucasus.<sup id=\"xref109\"><a href=\"#fn109\">109<\/a><\/sup> New Armenian magnates appeared on the historical scene, as the Mantashev (Mantshian), Der Ghukassov and Gulbenkian families who became pioneers in exploiting the oil business throughout the Caspian regions and Mesopotamia in the early decades of the 20th century.<sup id=\"xref110\"><a href=\"#fn110\">110<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm139848954904000\">Although Armenian success continued on a more modest scale in Russia, by the time of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the Sovietisation of the Caucasus, the Armenian world had already developed beyond West Asia (Iranian Plateau, Anatolia and the Caucasus).<\/p><p id=\"idm139848954919040\">Until then, history had forged the Armenian identity on continuity, strength and resilience to hardship. The division of Armenia and Armenians between empires had generated an Armenian political and economic networks which benefited the nation for over a millennium, linking Caucasian Armenia to Europe, Africa and the rest of Asia. With their degree of high mobility economically and geographically, the Armenians where in theory fit for the modern world.<sup id=\"xref111\"><a href=\"#fn111\">111<\/a><\/sup> However, even the most tenacious of diaspora nations could not thwart decades of consecutive adversity and disasters.

Analysing the geopolitical competition for Caspian energy resources, this article argues that the New Great Game framework has its limitations as it fails to incorporate the active role played by the Newly Independent Caspian (NIC) states. One cannot deny the fact that the strategic competition among the geopolitical powers for hydrocarbon resources of the Caspian shaped the trajectories of the new pipeline routes. At the same time, the NIC states, namely, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan benefited from the competition as they managed to diversify their export options, achieving greater political and economic independence. In the end, the interaction between the NIC states and energy consumers has led to strengthened energy cooperation along the same area where the ancient Silk Road crossed East Asia, Central Asia and Europe. The findings support the theoretical argument of the article, which stipulates that in exploring the developments in the Caspian region both realist and liberal theories of international relations should be applied in conjunction.<\/p><\/div>\n",

In the aftermath of the Soviet dissolution, the New Great Game in the Caspian region involved multiple actors such as China, Russia and the U.S.<sup id=\"xref3\"><a href=\"#fn3\">3<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm46016914781040\">The U.S. endorsed its East-West Energy Corridor initiative, which diverts hydrocarbon resources of the Caspian region to the West, effectively bypassing China, Iran and Russia. Moscow had been attempting to maintain its influence in the region through different mechanisms, including regional integration within the framework of the newly created Eurasian Economic Union. China was a latecomer in the Caspian region as its investment poured in the region only from the late 1990s. Nevertheless, Beijing managed to achieve significant participation in several oil projects in Central Asia and established direct supplies of energy from the region. Furthermore, in 2013, China announced \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative, which is projected to foster trade and energy cooperation Asia, Europe and Central Eurasia.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914852736\">As the competition between the key players attracted increased attention, the Great Game narrative was widely applied in the analysis of contemporary Central Asian space.<sup id=\"xref4\"><a href=\"#fn4\">4<\/a><\/sup> At the same time, several authors<sup id=\"xref5\"><a href=\"#fn5\">5<\/a><\/sup> have questioned the validity of the application of the concept of \u201cthe Great Game\u201d in relation to the interactions in Central Asia. However, most publications assessed relations between Central Asian states and global superpowers in general terms, without reference to cooperation in specific sectors. This article aims to fill this gap and evaluates the development of energy recourses of the Caspian energy-rich states and their relations with major geopolitical actors in the region.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914878160\">Applying the theory of realism<sup id=\"xref6\"><a href=\"#fn6\">6<\/a><\/sup> in international relations, this article will attempt to illustrate how the geopolitical struggle between the main actors in the Caspian region has expressed itself in different forms over the two decades after the end of the Cold War. However, as this article will argue, applying the realist framework may not be sufficient in exploring interactions of actors in the Caspian region as it focuses primarily on pursuit of power and geostrategic interests by dominating actors.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914896944\">To look from an alternative perspective, this article employs the liberalist theory<sup id=\"xref7\"><a href=\"#fn7\">7<\/a><\/sup> to analyse the development of energy resources of the region focusing on mutual benefits and international cooperation. To some extent, the NIC states have been able to take advantage of the environment of \u201cgeopolitical pluralism\u201d<sup id=\"xref8\"><a href=\"#fn8\">8<\/a><\/sup> (as defined by Brzezinski) although these countries were constrained by other factors such as landlocked geographic position as well as limited access to capital and technology.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016911938832\">Overall, as this article will argue, the geopolitical competition between the powerful actors had been beneficial for the NIC states as they utilised this rivalry to balance the presence of global powers and to diversify their energy export routes. Particularly, more visible presence of China in the second decade after independence allowed the Caspian states to \u201cplay the balancing act\u201d between the political powers in the region. Furthermore, the geopolitical rivalry between global powers positively affected the NIC countries\u2019 bargaining powers in relations with investors.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46016914730560\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">The pre-independence and early independence period<\/h3><p id=\"idm46016914745424\">With the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991, the three NIC states faced the challenge of delivering their oil and gas exports to world markets. All three NIC countries are landlocked, without direct access to oceans, which makes it impossible to ship to world markets directly from production sites. To deliver oil to nearest distribution points, the new pipelines had to be constructed. The existing pipeline system of the Soviet Union was built in such a manner that oil and gas from the Caspian region had to be exported to Russia first and then to world markets.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016912660480\">The Soviet pipeline system was not intentionally designed to limit transportation of the Caspian hydrocarbons to global markets. During the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) era, most of oil and gas from Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan was utilised for domestic use.<sup id=\"xref9\"><a href=\"#fn9\">9<\/a><\/sup> For example, oil from West Kazakhstan was piped to refineries within a short distance in the country or to South-East Russia and then further distributed among the Soviet Republics. Similarly, crude from Baku was mainly transported to nearest refineries in Grozny. Since the NIC states are landlocked, pipeline routes through Russia constituted a natural choice as it allowed exports without paying transit fees to third countries.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016911799840\">In the post-1991 period, global and regional powers pulled the NIC countries in different directions. The three Caspian states had similar choices for future pipeline routes. First, the \u201cWestern route,\u201d lobbied by the U.S. and the EU, was designed to deliver oil and gas from the NIC countries to Georgia and Turkey bypassing Russian and Iranian territories. Accordingly, the East-West Energy Corridor initiative included the construction of energy transportation infrastructure connecting Caspian region with Turkey through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) the South Caucasus pipelines. It was further planned to build Trans-Caspian pipelines, connecting East Caspian states (Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan) with Baku.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914744480\">Second, the \u201cSouthern route\u201d through Iran towards the Persian Gulf was the shortest and arguably the cheapest way to deliver Caspian hydrocarbons to global oil markets. However, this option was complicated by the determination of the U.S. and its allies to isolate Iran. Meanwhile, the \u201cEastern route\u201d was offered by China, which by the beginning of the 21st century gradually turned into one of the biggest energy consumers. Central Asian states\u2019 desire to diversify their export routes matched with China\u2019s struggle to diversify its energy supplies. In the meantime, Russia actively advocated the \u201cNorthern route,\u201d offering Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan access to Novorossiysk port in the Black Sea.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914761456\">After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the domestic consumption in the NIC states remained at low levels, and the question of export routes arose almost immediately. The capacity of existing pipelines was clearly not enough to export increasing volumes of Caspian oil and gas. Therefore, both governments of the NIC states and foreign multinationals were convinced that the new export lines had to be constructed. The crucial issue was around the directions, through which the Caspian oil and gas will be delivered to markets. Despite the urgency of the matter, it took more than a decade for each Caspian state to complete the new export pipelines.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46016914773472\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">The main geopolitical powers in the region<\/h3><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46016914851776\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">The U.S. influence in the Caspian region<\/h4><p id=\"idm46016914892768\">The U.S. strategy in the Caspian region pursued multiple objectives. First, it sought to protect its commercial interests by mitigating risks related to the delivery of Caspian hydrocarbons to global markets by multinational corporations. Second, the U.S. limited the Russian and Iranian influence in the region by supporting pipeline projects, which bypassed the latter two countries. In achieving these objectives, Washington introduced the East-West Energy Corridor Initiative, which was designed to connect Central Asia and South Caucasus. In April 1998, the U.S. Secretary of Energy Federico Pena stated that the Corridor is designed to \u201clink the countries in the region to the west.\u201d He further summarised the key projects in the region, supported by the U.S.:<\/p><div class=\"blockquote\"><a id=\"idm46016911856480\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><p class=\"first\" id=\"idm46016914745872\">Our East-West Energy Corridor initiative principally supports the construction of trans-Caspian oil and gas pipelines running under the Caspian Sea, linking the countries on the western Caspian shore \u2013 Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan \u2013 with those on the west, starting with Azerbaijan in the coastal city of Baku. [\u2026]. Development of oil and gas pipelines along this corridor will serve as the glue that binds all of these countries together as it will both encourage and require regional cooperation, at many junctures and on many levels.<sup id=\"xref10\"><a href=\"#fn10\">10<\/a><\/sup><\/p><\/div><p id=\"idm46016914726544\">Numerous official visits of the U.S. government officials to the region illustrate an active involvement of Washington in promoting energy cooperation with the Caspian states. In April 1995, the U.S. Energy Department Deputy Secretary William White visited Central Asia and Caucasus states to discuss issues with respect to pipeline projects. White expressed strong support for the BTC project stating that there is enough oil in the Caspian to feed the pipeline to Mediterranean as well as the pipeline to the Black Sea through Russia.<sup id=\"xref11\"><a href=\"#fn11\">11<\/a><\/sup> In October 1998, presidents of Turkey, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan signed the Ankara Declaration, expressing the willingness to cooperate on the BTC. The U.S. Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson attended the summit and expressed strong support for the project.<sup id=\"xref12\"><a href=\"#fn12\">12<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm46016914729136\">The BTC pipeline was named \u201cAmerica\u2019s most important Eurasian strategic initiative since the Soviet collapse.\u201d<sup id=\"xref13\"><a href=\"#fn13\">13<\/a><\/sup> In addition, the U.S. actively supported the construction of the South Caucasus pipeline. This pipeline together with the BTC route constitutes a part of the East-West Energy Corridor Initiative. Although Turkmenistan was initially reluctant to support the East-West Energy Corridor initiative openly, it readily accepted the U.S. proposal to construct the TAPI pipeline. However, the biggest obstacle for realisation of this \u201cSouth Eastern route\u201d project was instability in Afghanistan.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914752640\">The U.S. was cautious about strengthening of Iran\u2019s influence over the supplies of the Caspian oil.<sup id=\"xref14\"><a href=\"#fn14\">14<\/a><\/sup> Therefore, the TAPI pipeline project prevented the construction of Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline. The U.S. opposition was the main obstacle in building pipeline projects to the Persian Gulf. In 1996, the U.S. introduced the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, which threatened to apply commercial sanctions against any company that invests more than $20\u00a0million in the energy industry in Iran.<sup id=\"xref15\"><a href=\"#fn15\">15<\/a><\/sup> Therefore, the Caspian countries preferred to conclude swap agreements with Iran as such deals are not considered as an investment.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914761680\">After the completion of the BTC pipeline, the U.S. engagement in the Caspian region had been less active. Arguing that \u201cWest\u2019s work is done in Central Asia,\u201d Denison<sup id=\"xref16\"><a href=\"#fn16\">16<\/a><\/sup> pointed out that in the medium-term, the external actors will focus on ensuring contract stability rather than engaging in geopolitical struggle. Particularly in Kazakhstan, the U.S. companies secured the dominant position (about 75% in major projects) in energy sector during the 1990s and since then, their primary effort was focused not on expanding their participation but on maintaining the acquired energy assets.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46016914768480\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Russian influence in the Caspian region<\/h4><p id=\"idm46016914771216\">In the meantime, Russia sought the increasing domination of the U.S. multinationals as a threat to its strategic position in the region. During the first few years after the Soviet disintegration, Russia has not been an active player in the region because Moscow was largely preoccupied with domestic conflicts and economic problems. Eager to strengthen their independence, the NIC countries sought to construct new pipeline routes bypassing Russian territory.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914774640\">By the end of 1990s, witnessing increasing participation of American companies in the region, Russia responded with counteractive actions by demanding stakes in some energy projects in the NIC countries. Russian Fuel and Energy Minister Shafranik argued that the NIC states owe Russia a debt for investments made during the USSR period.<sup id=\"xref17\"><a href=\"#fn17\">17<\/a><\/sup> With Putin coming to power in 2000, Moscow\u2019s strategy in the Caspian region became more consolidated. The new government sought to maintain Russia\u2019s role as the major transhipment corridor in the region. Shortly after being elected to the presidency, Putin appointed his Special Representative in the Caspian Region, which mirrored the U.S. Special Advisor for Caspian Basin Energy Diplomacy.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914781568\">It should be noted that the relations between the U.S. and Russia in the region have not always been in the form of competition. Companies from both countries cooperated in a number of projects, including the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) pipeline construction. Initially, the U.S. was reluctant to build a pipeline, which would be under Russian control and attempted to persuade Kazakhstan to build a connection to the BTC.<sup id=\"xref18\"><a href=\"#fn18\">18<\/a><\/sup> However, Kazakhstan\u2019s position was to maintain ties with Russia, at the same time, securing the Western investment. Russia itself started using the \u201cWestern\u201d pipeline when Lukoil started shipments of crude from offshore Yuri Korchagin deposit through the BTC pipeline in 2014.<sup id=\"xref19\"><a href=\"#fn19\">19<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm46016914860080\">Russia has been active in maintaining its monopoly in supplying the European markets with natural gas. Moscow purchased large bulks of Turkmen gas, diminishing Turkmenistan\u2019s need to look for alternative routes. However, the two countries had some unresolved disputes, which exacerbated after 2009, and the exports of Turkmen gas in the Northern direction dramatically dropped. Effectively blocking the construction of the Trans-Caspian pipeline, Russia in its turn constructed the Blue Stream pipeline to export gas to Turkey.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914862976\">The South Stream was designed to deliver Russian gas towards Central Europe, but the project was cancelled in the aftermath of the 2014 Crimea crisis and due to unresolved controversies between Russia and the EU. In December 2014, during the visit of President Putin to Turkey, the two countries agreed to replace the South Stream with the Turkish Stream gas pipeline, which will stretch across the Black Sea. The initial planned capacity of the pipeline was 63\u00a0bcm of gas, which was later reduced to 32\u00a0bcm. It was estimated that around half of the gas would be consumed in Turkey and another half would be transported further to Europe. However, in the light of worsening bilateral relations between Russia and Turkey, Gazprom suspended the construction of the Turkish Stream pipeline in November 2015.<sup id=\"xref20\"><a href=\"#fn20\">20<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm46016914867152\">The crisis in Russian-Turkish relations escalated when Turkey actively opposed Russian military actions in Syria. In November 2015, Turkey shut Russian military plane, which allegedly crossed the Turkish territory on a way to bombing Syria. In response, Moscow closed its trade with Turkey and announced the suspension of the Turkish Stream pipeline construction. Shortly after the Russian-Turkish dispute, Azerbaijan and Turkey announced the acceleration of works in the construction of the Trans-Anatolian gas pipeline (TANAP), which is projected to be completed in 2018. Russia and Turkey restored diplomatic relations in August 2016, and two months later, President Putin and President Erdogan signed a new energy deal agreeing to continue the construction of the Turkish Stream pipeline.<sup id=\"xref21\"><a href=\"#fn21\">21<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm46016914874384\">The recent developments may lead to a revival of the discussions regarding the East-West Energy Corridor, which will enable exports of Kazakh and Turkmen gas to Europe through Turkey. The EU\u2019s reliance on Russian gas is considerable, as the latter supplies about 30% of EU gas, which is about 150\u00a0bcm per year.<sup id=\"xref22\"><a href=\"#fn22\">22<\/a><\/sup> Instability in Russia\u2019s relations with transit countries such as Ukraine and Turkey also threatens the security of gas supplies to Europe. Therefore, the EU countries are increasingly keen to end their dependence on Russian natural gas supplies.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914878400\">In 2003, Brussels endorsed the Nabucco gas pipeline project, which is projected to supply the EU with natural gas from Azerbaijan, the Middle East and Central Asia. The pipeline challenges Russian dominance, and it is competing with Moscow-supported South Stream and Turkish stream projects.<sup id=\"xref23\"><a href=\"#fn23\">23<\/a><\/sup> Although the Nabucco project was frozen in 2013, the EU initiated the Southern Gas Corridor project, which will connect the NIC countries with Europe. As part of this project, in March 2015, Turkey launched the construction of the Trans-Anatolian pipeline (TANAP). The missing link is the Trans-Caspian pipeline connection between Azerbaijan and the two eastern Caspian states Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914888736\">In the end, Moscow was not able to sustain the full control over all energy export routes from the Caspian. Azerbaijan secured its export volumes through the BTC pipeline, whereas Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan managed to diversify routes by building energy transportation links to China. The only route that Russia and Iran collectively blocked was the Trans-Caspian pipeline, where they appealed to environmental concerns to prevent the construction.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46016914893008\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">China\u2019s influence in the Caspian region<\/h4><p id=\"idm46016914894736\">As a result of an active involvement since 1998, China achieved significant participation in Caspian region\u2019s energy sector. Although building pipelines from the region required substantial investment, this has not deterred Beijing. At the moment of completion, the Sino-Kazakh pipeline was the longest existing oil pipeline, whereas the CAC (Central Asia-China) is the longest existing gas pipeline in the world. Over the second decade of independence, Kazakhstan turned into China\u2019s primary oil supplier in Central Asia, whereas Turkmenistan is now China\u2019s major gas supplier.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914896512\">China\u2019s main motivation in involvement in the Caspian region has been its increasing domestic energy demand. Having a very limited access to the Persian Gulf oil market, Beijing hastened to ensure the security of energy supplies from the Caspian basin. Most of the Chinese hydrocarbon imports from the Middle East and Africa pass through the Strait of Malacca, which is under the U.S. control. Therefore, in diversifying energy supply sources, Central Asia is China\u2019s natural choice as no shipment is required.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914898528\">The Central Asia-China gas pipeline, which connected China to main production fields in Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, was inaugurated in December 2009. This 1,800\u00a0km long pipeline is projected to carry 40\u00a0billion cubic meters of natural gas annually. The launch of the pipeline was named a turning point in the development of Central Asian resources.<sup id=\"xref24\"><a href=\"#fn24\">24<\/a><\/sup> This pipeline met Central Asian states\u2019 expectations to diversify their export routes in order to weaken dependence from Russia.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914747552\">Moscow\u2019s position about this development was neutral because the pipeline directs Central Asian gas exports away from the European market, which is the main destination for Russian gas. It should be noted that the pipeline passes Xinjiang district in China, where separatist movements were active among the ethnic Uighur population. China\u2019s concern was that Central Asian states would support the rebellion Uighur population in Xinjiang, which are ethnically close to Central Asian nations. From this perspective, it is important for China to maintain positive bilateral relations with Central Asian states.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914747264\">Some analysts argued that China is playing increasingly important role in the region<sup id=\"xref25\"><a href=\"#fn25\">25<\/a><\/sup> and some went as far as to state that China has come to \u201cdisplace both the United States and Russia\u201d<sup id=\"xref26\"><a href=\"#fn26\">26<\/a><\/sup> in the region. Others argued that Chinese investment is largely predetermined by energy security concerns, and it does not seem to be challenging the geopolitical domination of the U.S. and Russia.<sup id=\"xref27\"><a href=\"#fn27\">27<\/a><\/sup> The announcement of China\u2019s \u201cOne Belt One Road\u201d ambitious initiative in 2013 started a new phase in China\u2019s cooperation with the states in the region.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46016914769920\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Summary<\/h4><p id=\"idm46016914775936\">As it was evidenced from the previous sections, the strategic competition among the regional and external powers greatly influenced the trajectory of the new pipeline routes in the Caspian region. The implementation of the East-West Energy Corridor initiative, which bypasses Russia and Iran, cannot be explained by economic logic but can be justified by strategic motivations. The BTC construction would never take place if not the political and financial support from the U.S. government. Moscow in its turn convinced Kazakhstan to build the CPC pipeline, which runs through the Russian territory. In the second decade after the collapse of the Soviet Union, China achieved significant success in tapping into Caspian energy resources through constructing oil and gas pipelines in Central Asia. Other regional players such as Turkey and Georgia also benefitted from having the BTC pipeline on their land, whereas Armenia\u2019s isolation worsened.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914782224\">A great deal of political risk contained in that the pipeline routes from the Caspian basin crossed the unstable conflict zones in Abkhazia, Chechnya and Nagorno-Karabakh. The upsurge of social and political conflicts in the Caspian and Caucasus regions in the 1990s hampered the smooth development of pipeline transportation infrastructure. Another factor that had an impact on new pipeline construction was the unsettled status of the Caspian Sea. The lack of the demarcation agreement prevented Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Iran from collaborating in joint pipeline projects in the Caspian Sea. In addition, the absence of an agreement on the status of the sea also restrained Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan from building a Trans-Caspian pipeline.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914781776\">As it is often the case in oil and gas industry, when the political interests involved, the economic rationale often steps off to the secondary stage. For all three NIC states, the most attractive and efficient route to take oil and gas to markets would be the pipeline through Iran to the Persian Gulf. However, the U.S. opposition deterred the plans to construct such a pipeline as it openly limited Iranian participation in energy projects in the region and expanded its own presence in region\u2019s largest oil projects. Moreover, Washington succeeded in persuading Azerbaijan to construct the BTC pipeline, which bypasses Russia and Iran.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914861856\">The outcome is that Iran had become an isolated regional player in the Caspian region. Although Iran\u2019s territory is relatively stable compared to rebellious areas in the South Caucasus, the country\u2019s intransigent position on the legal status of the Caspian Sea was an obstacle for its fruitful cooperation with the NIC countries. Nevertheless, Iran signed short-term swap agreements with the NIC countries to provide energy supplies to its intensely populated northern regions. In the light of recent events with relieving sanctions on Iran, there are several pipeline projects that will possibly move forward. Keen to end its dependence on Russian gas, the EU might use this opportunity to tap into Central Asian gas reserves by constructing the pipeline through Iranian territory. Similarly, oil from Kazakhstan\u2019s Kashagan field can be delivered to the Persian Gulf.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914861440\">To highlight constraints faced by the NIC states in constructing new energy export routes, the next section will provide case studies unfolding main factors that influenced pipeline trajectories in each of the NIC states.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46016914877568\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Azerbaijan\u2019s pipeline dilemma<\/h3><p id=\"idm46016914883568\">In the immediate years after independence, it was evident for Azerbaijan that the lack of export routes is one of the biggest challenges for the development of the country\u2019s energy sector. In 1994, the Azerbaijan International Operating company (AIOC) was established to develop the country\u2019s largest Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli oil deposits. The parties to the contract agreed to cooperate on the issue of the new pipeline construction. This responsibility of the AIOC members was important for the government because several oil multinationals were among the participants, including Russian Lukoil, European companies and oil firms from Japan and the U.S. From the beginning of its operations, the AIOC announced that the consortium is considering routes proposed by Georgia, Russia and Turkey.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914883280\">In the meantime, Azerbaijan decided to send its \u201cearly oil\u201d exports in two directions: through Baku-Grozny-Novorossiysk and Baku-Supsa routes.<\/p><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46016914888048\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">\u201cEarly oil\u201d pipeline routes<\/h4><p id=\"idm46016914889424\">The Baku-Grozny-Novorossiysk line partially existed in Soviet times, and it only needed an upgrade and extension. The AIOC planned to pump 120,000\u00a0b\/d of crude annually through the renewed pipeline.<sup id=\"xref28\"><a href=\"#fn28\">28<\/a><\/sup> However, the safety of this route was undermined as the two Russian-Chechen wars cut Russia off Azerbaijan, while more than 10% of 1,411\u00a0km of this pipeline was in the Chechen territory. During the 1996 war in Chechnya, the pipeline was damaged severely, and this interrupted oil exports. Following the cease-fire agreement between Russia and Chechnya in August 1996, Azerbaijan was intending to resume oil transportation to Novorossiysk but Transneft denied Azeri oil access to the line because it was not possible to ensure safe transportation.<sup id=\"xref29\"><a href=\"#fn29\">29<\/a><\/sup> Oil exports resumed only in the second half of 1998 after the reconstruction works commenced, and safety was guaranteed in the Chechen section of the route.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914759488\">Shortly after the pipeline was revived, Russia again had to close the Baku-Novorossiysk line in 1999 because the Second Chechen War took the pipeline out of control. Although the pipeline bypassing Chechnya and going through Dagestan was completed in 2000, Azerbaijan and the AIOC remained cautious about sending oil through this route. In the end, Azerbaijan indicated that Novorossiysk line could not serve as the main export route as it could carry only 105,000\u00a0b\/d,<sup id=\"xref30\"><a href=\"#fn30\">30<\/a><\/sup> which was only a small fraction of what the country wanted to send.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914808416\">Another export route for early oil from Azerbaijan was Baku-Supsa pipeline project. The pipeline existed since the Soviet times though the AIOC had to spend $600\u00a0million to renovate the line.<sup id=\"xref31\"><a href=\"#fn31\">31<\/a><\/sup> This pipeline runs from Sangachal terminal near Baku towards Georgia\u2019s port of Supsa in the Black Sea. The agreement on the construction of the new pipeline between Azerbaijan and Georgia was concluded in March 1996, and the connection was completed by 1998. In the following year, the pipeline delivered its first oil to the Black Sea. The Baku-Supsa line\u2019s initial capacity was 150,000\u00a0b\/d, which was later upgraded to 250,000\u00a0b\/d.<sup id=\"xref32\"><a href=\"#fn32\">32<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm46016914737888\">It was evident that the capacity of the \u201cearly oil\u201d routes is not sufficient to carry the major bulk of oil when the production was projected to peak in Azerbaijan. Both Russia and Georgia proposed an upgrade of the existing routes, but Azerbaijan refused for several reasons. First, exports to Novorossiysk and Supsa had been a challenge for the AIOC during the period of early oil. The Russian route was a difficult one as the pipeline crosses the region, where the conflict lasted for many years. Similarly, the Baku-Supsa route would pass near politically unstable regions such as Nagorno-Karabakh, South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Ajaria. Second, Turkey opposed the plans for enlargement of the Baku-Supsa and the Baku-Novorossiysk routes on environmental concerns.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016911787808\">In 1994, Azerbaijan reached an agreement with Iran on oil transportation towards Turkey through the Iranian territory. Further to this, Azerbaijan and Iran concluded an oil swap deal in 1995, with the future intention to build a pipeline from Azerbaijan to the Persian Gulf.<sup id=\"xref33\"><a href=\"#fn33\">33<\/a><\/sup> In the light of growing cooperation and to further strengthen bilateral ties, Azerbaijan offered Iran 5% share in the AIOC consortium. However, due to the pressure from the U.S., Azerbaijan unilaterally annulled the deal, which led to the deterioration of diplomatic relations between Baku and Tehran. After this incident, Iran\u2019s stance over the disputed areas in the Caspian Sea became more assertive and the tension even led to the use of military gunships in 2001.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46016914865344\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan route<\/h4><p id=\"idm46016914773056\">Turkey\u2019s initial proposal to build a pipeline from Baku towards the Turkish city of Ceyhan in Mediterranean was made in 1992.<sup id=\"xref34\"><a href=\"#fn34\">34<\/a><\/sup> Since that time, several governments changed in Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia, but the project was not abandoned. By the end of the 1990s, with low oil prices and the financial crisis in most of the Post-Soviet states, the pipeline project was seen unrealistic. The complexity of the issue is illustrated by the fact that it took more than a decade to get the BTC pipeline to deliver its first oil.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914879792\">Azerbaijan sympathised this route because it would provide direct access to world markets from Ceyhan port on the Mediterranean coast. Turkey\u2019s proposal contained two possible deviations of the pipeline routes: one through Georgia and another through the Armenian territory. Although the second route was shorter, it was rejected outright by Azerbaijan in the light of the Azeri-Armenian conflict around Nagorno-Karabakh issue.<sup id=\"xref35\"><a href=\"#fn35\">35<\/a><\/sup> The unresolved territorial conflict has kept the two countries hostile to each other since the end of the 1980s.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914891168\">Turkey assured that the BTC pipeline would be the \u201csafest and most economical\u201d route to deliver oil from Caspian region towards Mediterranean. However, the two problems with the BTC pipeline concerned exactly the economic feasibility and safety of the project. First, the pipeline is 1,768\u00a0km long, which is twice longer than the Baku-Supsa route (833\u00a0km). Therefore, the concerns regarding the economic rationale for building such a costly project appeared often. Although the initial cost of the pipeline was estimated at around $2.5\u00a0billion, the final cost of the construction was $3.9\u00a0billion.<sup id=\"xref36\"><a href=\"#fn36\">36<\/a><\/sup> Second, although Turkey guaranteed the safety of oil transportation, the route passed the areas, where Kurdish separatist movements were active. Nevertheless, the AIOC never expressed concerns regarding this issue but seemed to be more concerned with financing such a grandiose project.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914850768\">The dynamics changed by the early 2000s when the recovery of the oil prices revitalised the debates around the BTC construction. Although the U.S. had been expressing support for the BTC project, oil multinationals, including the U.S.-based ExxonMobil, Pennzoil and Russian Lukoil, were less enthusiastic about investing in the pipeline and refused to provide financing.<sup id=\"xref37\"><a href=\"#fn37\">37<\/a><\/sup> Later in 2002, Lukoil sold its stake in the AIOC project. Countering the resistance of some AIOC members against the pipeline, the U.S. government decided to contribute $827\u00a0million towards the construction of the pipeline. The transaction was made through American financial agencies such as the Export-Import Bank, Overseas Private Investment Corporation and Trade and Development Agency.<sup id=\"xref38\"><a href=\"#fn38\">38<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm46016913938064\">International Financial Organisations (IFOs) also provided the financial support for the BTC pipeline construction. It has been suggested that the U.S. government pressured the World Bank to finance the BTC pipeline and to reject applications for financial support for other pipelines. The U.S. justified the construction of the pipeline with the plans to export oil from Kazakhstan via the BTC. As the Senior Advisor to President Bush on Caspian Energy issues commented: \u201c[w]e want the Kazakh oil to be fed into Baku-Ceyhan\u2026 [that] means the World Bank won\u2019t pay for any Iranian pipeline.\u201d<sup id=\"xref39\"><a href=\"#fn39\">39<\/a><\/sup> Eventually, the World Bank agreed to provide $300\u00a0million loan for the project.<sup id=\"xref40\"><a href=\"#fn40\">40<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm46016915164128\">Finally, the BTC construction commenced in 2002 and the first oil reached Ceyhan only by mid-2006. However, even after the completion of the pipeline, sceptics expressed concerns regarding the feasibility of the project. Failure to find further commercial discoveries in the Azerbaijani sector of the Caspian Sea made it difficult to utilise the pipeline for its full capacity (one million barrels per day). Considering that three of the Kashagan shareholders, namely, Eni, TotalFinaElf and Itochu jointly hold 13.4% of the BTC, it is possible that the pipeline will become one of the primary export routes for Kazakhstan (<a href=\"#T1\">Table 1<\/a>).<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid table-container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-sm-8\"><div class=\"img-table-footer row\"><p class=\"fig-title\">Table 1 - The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline shareholders.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div class=\"col-sm-4\"><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-right\"><a href=\"#T1\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span>Enlarge Table\n                        <\/a><br\/><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row inline-content\" id=\"article-table\"><div class=\"table-overflow\"><table class=\"table table-hover\" id=\"T1\"><col width=\"7ac\"\/><col width=\"6ac\"\/><col width=\"5ac\"\/><thead><tr><th>Shareholder<\/th><th align=\"center\">Country<\/th><th align=\"center\">Share (%)<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>BP (operator)<\/td><td align=\"center\">UK<\/td><td align=\"center\">30.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>AzBTC<\/td><td align=\"center\">Azerbaijan<\/td><td align=\"center\">25<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Chevron<\/td><td align=\"center\">U.S.<\/td><td align=\"center\">8.90<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Statoil<\/td><td align=\"center\">Norway<\/td><td align=\"center\">8.71<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TP<\/td><td align=\"center\">Turkey<\/td><td align=\"center\">6.53<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Eni<\/td><td align=\"center\">Italy<\/td><td align=\"center\">5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td align=\"center\">France<\/td><td align=\"center\">5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Itochu<\/td><td align=\"center\">Japan<\/td><td align=\"center\">3.40<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Inpex<\/td><td align=\"center\">Japan<\/td><td align=\"center\">2.50<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CIECO<\/td><td align=\"center\">UK<\/td><td align=\"center\">2.50<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ONGC Videsh<\/td><td align=\"center\">India<\/td><td align=\"center\">2.36<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/div><div class=\"table-wrap-foot\"><div class=\"fig-description\"><i>Adapted from BP website, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bp.com\/en_az\/caspian\/operationsprojects\/pipelines\/BTC.html\" id=\"idm46016915223360\">http:\/\/www.bp.com\/en_az\/caspian\/operationsprojects\/pipelines\/BTC.html<\/a>.<\/i><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><p id=\"idm46016915160928\">The military conflict between Russia and Georgia in August 2008 caused disruptions in the functioning of the BTC.

The companies resumed their exports via the BTC pipeline shortly after the Russian-Georgian conflict was resolved.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016915160640\">It had been pointed out that given the availability of cheaper routes, the construction of the BTC pipeline made no economic sense. The final cost of the BTC, which was referred to as the longest and the most expensive route to transport Azeri oil to world markets, amounted $3.9\u00a0billion. To compare, the projected cost of Baku-Novorossiysk line reconstruction was $2.5\u00a0billion, while the route through Iran would be the shortest and the most economical with the projected cost of only $1\u00a0billion.<sup id=\"xref42\"><a href=\"#fn42\">42<\/a><\/sup> With the BTC project, not only the investing companies undertook enormous financial burden but also Azerbaijan received fewer rents from the AIOC until its members recouped their investments. Therefore, the pipeline projects such as the BTC, South Caucasus pipeline and the projected Trans-Caspian pipeline were primarily driven by political considerations.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46016913947104\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Azerbaijan\u2019s natural gas transportation<\/h4><p id=\"idm46016913946336\">The problem of natural gas exports was not acute in Azerbaijan until the discovery of gas deposits in 1999. Until that time, the country relied on Russian gas supplies. With the start of gas production at Shah Deniz field in late 2006, Azerbaijan became a gas exporter on its own. To deliver its gas to markets, Azerbaijan collaborated with Turkey to construct 692\u00a0km long gas pipeline known as the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum (BTE) or the South Caucasus pipeline. The pipeline\u2019s trajectory is similar to the BTC: it runs from Baku through Tbilisi and then further to the port of Erzurum in Turkey. The first stage of the Shah Deniz project secured gas supplies to Georgia and Turkey, whereas the next stage of the project will deliver Azeri gas to Europe via Trans-Anatolian (TANAP) and Trans-Adriatic (TAP) gas pipelines.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914753328\">The construction of the TANAP pipeline started in March 2015 and is projected to be completed by 2018. The tension between Russia and Turkey, which started in 2015, is likely to have consequences on gas trade in the region. With the completion of the TANAP, Azerbaijan will have an opportunity to become Turkey\u2019s main supplier of natural gas. The TANAP and the TAP connections threaten to undermine Russian monopoly over gas exports to European markets. Interestingly, disputes between Azerbaijan and Russia around gas supplies in 2006 have not deterred Lukoil from becoming one of the shareholders in the Shah Deniz project (10%) and in the South Caucasus pipeline (<a href=\"#T2\">Table 2<\/a>). As part of the 2007 Azeri-Iranian agreement, Azerbaijan exported small amounts of gas to Iran, whereas the latter supplies Azerbaijan\u2019s Nakhichevan exclave with natural gas.<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid table-container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-sm-8\"><div class=\"img-table-footer row\"><p class=\"fig-title\">Table 2 - The South Caucasus pipeline (BTE) shareholders.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div class=\"col-sm-4\"><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-right\"><a href=\"#T2\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span>Enlarge Table\n                        <\/a><br\/><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row inline-content\" id=\"article-table\"><div class=\"table-overflow\"><table class=\"table table-hover\" id=\"T2\"><col width=\"8pc\"\/><col width=\"6pc\"\/><col width=\"6pc\"\/><thead><tr><th>Shareholder<\/th><th align=\"center\">Country<\/th><th align=\"center\">Share (%)<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>BP (operator)<\/td><td align=\"center\">UK<\/td><td align=\"center\">28.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TPAO<\/td><td align=\"center\">Turkey<\/td><td align=\"center\">19<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>AzSCP<\/td><td align=\"center\">Azerbaijan<\/td><td align=\"center\">10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Petronas<\/td><td align=\"center\">Malaysia<\/td><td align=\"center\">15.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Lukoil<\/td><td align=\"center\">Russia<\/td><td align=\"center\">10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Naftiran Intertrade<\/td><td align=\"center\">Iran<\/td><td align=\"center\">10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SGC Midstream<\/td><td align=\"center\">Azerbaijan<\/td><td align=\"center\">6.7<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/div><div class=\"table-wrap-foot\"><div class=\"fig-description\"><i>Adapted from BP website, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bp.com\/en_az\/caspian\/operationsprojects\/pipelines\/SCP.html\" id=\"idm46016915172336\">http:\/\/www.bp.com\/en_az\/caspian\/operationsprojects\/pipelines\/SCP.html<\/a>.<\/i><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46016914900464\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Summary<\/h4><p id=\"idm46016914899664\">Azerbaijan sought to break its ties with Russia in the beginning of the 1990s and allied closely with the U.S. and Turkey. The country distanced itself from Moscow because the latter supported Armenia in the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. Moreover, Baku perceived with caution Russian attempts to restore its domination in the Caspian region. At the same time, Azerbaijan welcomed oil majors because Western oil companies had the technology and capital to invest in offshore fields. In doing so, Azerbaijan aimed to secure Western support in its continuous confrontation with Armenia.<sup id=\"xref43\"><a href=\"#fn43\">43<\/a><\/sup> However, eventually, Azerbaijan has not found support from the West in the resolution of its conflict with Armenia, which prompted Baku to gradually restore trade relations with Russia.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914849840\">It can be argued that Azerbaijan had a variety of options from which to choose its main oil export routes. Russia, Turkey, Georgia and Iran entered a competition, proposing new pipelines to be constructed through their territories. Even Armenia offered to build the pipeline through its territory, expressing readiness to make concessions in resolving the territorial dispute. Other countries that proposed pipeline routes through their territory include Romania, Bulgaria, Greece and Ukraine. In the end, Baku rejected all these offers, opting instead for the BTC pipeline project.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914848800\">At the regional level, the competition was about the benefits that the pipeline would bring to a transit country. On the one hand, the new BTC pipeline significantly increased the geopolitical significance of Georgia and Turkey, also bringing the two countries economic benefits in the form of transit fees. For example, Georgia will receive an average of $62.5\u00a0million per year in transit fees during the operation of the BTC.<sup id=\"xref44\"><a href=\"#fn44\">44<\/a><\/sup> On the other hand, the project worsened the economic isolation of Armenia, which allied with Russia seeking for support in the unresolved conflict with Azerbaijan.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914742096\">The BTC case illustrates that the construction of the pipeline is a political choice rather than commercial as economic interests had to give way to political considerations. It is for this reason that the BTC pipeline was named a \u201cpolitical pipeline.\u201d<sup id=\"xref45\"><a href=\"#fn45\">45<\/a><\/sup> Concerns over the commercial feasibility of the project have not played a decisive role. Nevertheless, Azerbaijan opted for the BTC pipeline, even though it was significantly costlier than the Southern route. Even though the companies in the AIOC expressed concerns about the commercial feasibility of the project, this has not deterred Azerbaijan from building the pipeline.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46016914858112\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Kazakhstan\u2019s pipe dreams<\/h3><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46016914857344\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Kazakhstan\u2019s \u201cearly oil\u201d export routes<\/h4><p id=\"idm46016914856576\">Like Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan faced similar problems with exporting its crude to global markets. Having the biggest oil reserves among the NIC states, the country attracted big-name foreign investors during the 1990s to sign multi-billion dollar investment contracts. Developing hydrocarbon deposits was beyond the capabilities of domestic companies. On the day of obtaining independence in December 1991 and up until 1998, Kazakhstan was in the possession of only one major export connection \u2014 the Atyrau-Samara pipeline. This pipeline pumped oil from the Kazakh coast of the Caspian Sea to the terminals in the Russian city of Samara and then further to world markets through the Druzhba pipeline system. Kazakhstan\u2019s internal pipeline network was also largely underdeveloped. As the output from the Caspian basin was projected to expand, the construction of the main export routes became an urgent matter.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914736128\">Kazakhstan\u2019s biggest (at the time) oilfield Tengiz was discovered during the Soviet era in 1979 and shortly after that Chevron entered negotiations with Gorbachev\u2019s governments to obtain the licence to develop the field. The contract was finalised in 1993 between independent Kazakhstan and Chevron forming the Tengizchevroil (TCO) joint venture. Almost at the same period, Kazakhstan and Chevron began to seek investment for constructing an export line. In March 1993, Kazakhstan and Russia agreed to utilise the Atyrau-Samara pipeline for oil exports from Tengiz. However, this was only a temporary solution as the pipeline\u2019s export capacity limited. By 1998, the export capacity of TCO consortium increased to 90,000\u00a0b\/d, but the pipeline could carry only 65,000\u00a0b\/d, and even this was often interrupted.<sup id=\"xref46\"><a href=\"#fn46\">46<\/a><\/sup> Moreover, Kazakhstan planned to expand the oil output further with new discoveries being made in the Kazakh sector of the Caspian Sea.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914735840\">Despite the existence of the Kazakh-Russian bilateral agreement on oil transportation, Russia limited oil exports through the Atyrau-Samara pipeline. Russian pipeline monopoly Transneft imposed quotas on the exports from Kazakhstan and disrupted transits from Kazakhstan, complaining about high sulphur concentration in the oil. To address the problem, Chevron had to invest about $100\u00a0million in equipment to remove sulphur compounds.<sup id=\"xref47\"><a href=\"#fn47\">47<\/a><\/sup> However, the permit by Russia to transport the oil has not been consistent even within the agreed quota. Following this, in 1998, Chevron temporary froze its investments for Tengiz. This hampered the development of the project and undermined Kazakhstan\u2019s grand ambitions to become one of the major oil producers.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016915035920\">In the absence of any other connections to the rest of the world, Kazakhstan had to export oil via alternative routes: via rail to Russia and China, by oil tankers across the Caspian to Baku. Kazakhstan also delivered its oil to Russia by shipment of Tengiz oil on tankers to the Black Sea through the Volga-Don canal system. In addition, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan agreed to send Kazakh oil by tankers across the Caspian Sea to Baku. Due to disagreements about the transit fees, in February 1999, TCO suspended tanker shipments to Baku in February 1999. Shipments to Baku resumed with the completion of the BTC pipeline in 2002. By 2001, Kazakhstan was exporting around 350,000\u00a0b\/d of its oil by rail and tankers.<sup id=\"xref48\"><a href=\"#fn48\">48<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm46016915822096\">In 1996, Kazakhstan and Iran concluded the first swap deal. Under this deal, Kazakhstan would ship its oil to the Iranian port of Neka in the Caspian Sea, whereas Iran would deliver an equivalent amount of its own oil to the Persian Gulf for Kazakhstan. As Western multinationals could not work with Iran, Kazakhstan\u2019s Mangistaumunaigas oil company conducted the swap operations. However, international sanctions against Iran made the swap operations problematic and deliveries interrupted several times. In 2005, the countries resumed the swap operations but only for the period until 2010. In October 2015, with sanctions lifted from Iran, Kazakhstan initiated resuming of crude swaps with Iran.<sup id=\"xref49\"><a href=\"#fn49\">49<\/a><\/sup><\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46016911789184\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Construction of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium<\/h4><p id=\"idm46016914735264\">Although the construction of the new pipeline was an urgent need for both Kazakh government and TCO investors, the CPC pipeline was launched only in November 2001. The CPC is 1,510\u00a0km long pipeline, construction costs of which amounted $2.67\u00a0billion. The project\u2019s original transportation capacity is 450,000\u00a0b\/d,<sup id=\"xref50\"><a href=\"#fn50\">50<\/a><\/sup> which can be delivered from Tengiz to the Russian Novorossiysk port in the Black Sea. Although the decision on the pipeline construction was made in 1993, it took long to find investors for the project and then for investors to agree on sharing the costs and responsibilities.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914901680\">Initial members in the CPC project included only three countries, namely, Kazakhstan, Russia and Oman. It has been pointed out that Russia demanded a stake in the Tengiz project, in exchange for accepting the terms for the CPC pipeline.<sup id=\"xref51\"><a href=\"#fn51\">51<\/a><\/sup> After Russia\u2019s acquisition of an interest in the TCO was announced in 1995, the CPC implementation moved forward. However, the main issue with the financing of the pipeline was not resolved. The CPC shareholders approached the World Bank seeking for support with financing.<sup id=\"xref52\"><a href=\"#fn52\">52<\/a><\/sup> The World Bank\u2019s refusal to provide the loan had complicated the situation. In 1995, Kazakhstan approached the EBRD with the same request but again received a rejection.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016911797840\">As financing had become the bottleneck for the development of the project, Kazakhstan and Russia had no other choice than to invite Chevron, ExxonMobil and several other MNEs to become shareholders. Chevron agreed to finance half of the project costs in return for 25% of profits. Disagreeing with Chevron\u2019s requirements, Omani investors demanded that the company should contribute more and pay the transit fees.<sup id=\"xref53\"><a href=\"#fn53\">53<\/a><\/sup> In 1996, the dispute between the investors was finally resolved, and the restructuring of the CPC took place, which resulted in a decrease of Omani shares and entering of eight new private investors.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016911795840\">The U.S. company Mobil agreed to invest about $1\u00a0billion in exchange for 25% equity share in the TCO project and further 7.5% in the CPC consortium. Mobil and other private investors demanded that the pipeline should be in shared ownership. Although Russia was reluctant in letting other companies become shareholders of an oil pipeline crossing its territory, it had to make concessions as Kazakhstan could opt for an alternative route. Kazakhstan\u2019s President Nazarbayev pointed out:<\/p><div class=\"blockquote\"><a id=\"idm46016915068176\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><p class=\"first\" id=\"idm46016915067856\">Our policy towards it is a multi-vector one.

Oman eventually left the project in 2008 selling its 7% interest in the project to Russia.<sup id=\"xref55\"><a href=\"#fn55\">55<\/a><\/sup> In the end, Russia became the largest shareholder in the CPC with 44% of combined shares, whereas Kazakhstan holds 19%, and the remaining shares distributed among the investor companies (<a href=\"#T3\">Table 3<\/a>).<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid table-container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-sm-8\"><div class=\"img-table-footer row\"><p class=\"fig-title\">Table 3 - The Caspian Pipeline Consortium shareholders.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div class=\"col-sm-4\"><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-right\"><a href=\"#T3\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span>Enlarge Table\n                        <\/a><br\/><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row inline-content\" id=\"article-table\"><div class=\"table-overflow\"><table class=\"table table-hover\" id=\"T3\"><col width=\"15pc\"\/><col width=\"14pc\"\/><col width=\"5pc\"\/><thead><tr><th>Shareholder<\/th><th align=\"center\">Country<\/th><th align=\"center\">%<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Transneft<\/td><td align=\"center\">Russia<\/td><td align=\"center\">24<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KazMunaiGaz<\/td><td align=\"center\">Kazakhstan<\/td><td align=\"center\">19<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Chevron<\/td><td align=\"center\">U.S.<\/td><td align=\"center\">15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LUKARCO B.V.<\/td><td align=\"center\">Russia<\/td><td align=\"center\">12,5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mobil<\/td><td align=\"center\">U.S.<\/td><td align=\"center\">7,5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Rosneft-Shell Caspian Ventures Limited<\/td><td align=\"center\">Russia-United Kingdom-Netherlands<\/td><td align=\"center\">7,5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CTC Company<\/td><td align=\"center\">Russia<\/td><td align=\"center\">7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Eni<\/td><td align=\"center\">Italy<\/td><td align=\"center\">2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kazakhstan Pipeline Ventures LLC<\/td><td align=\"center\">Kazakhstan-United Kingdom<\/td><td align=\"center\">1,75<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Oryx Caspian Pipeline LLC<\/td><td align=\"center\">United Kingdom-Netherlands<\/td><td align=\"center\">1,75<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/div><div class=\"table-wrap-foot\"><div class=\"fig-description\"><i>Adapted from CPC website, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cpc.ru\/en\/about\/Pages\/shareholders.aspx\" id=\"idm46016914795120\">http:\/\/www.cpc.ru\/en\/about\/Pages\/shareholders.aspx<\/a>.<\/i><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><p id=\"idm46016917821488\">While bargaining with Russia about the Northern pipeline route, Kazakhstan was considering the option to build another export route through Iran. Although TCO member companies had an interest in constructing an export pipeline through Iran, the U.S. government strongly discouraged its businesses and even pressured Astana not to engage with Iran.<sup id=\"xref56\"><a href=\"#fn56\">56<\/a><\/sup> Instead, the U.S. proposed the construction of the Trans-Caspian pipeline from Aktau to Baku through the seabed of the Caspian. This route would take the Kazakh crude straight to the Mediterranean through the connection to the BTC.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016915071888\">The Kazakh government initially appeared enthusiastic about the Trans-Caspian line and even signed a memorandum of understanding with Turkey. However, Russia and Iran opposed this project stating that the pipeline would potentially cause an environmental disaster in the Caspian Sea. With the inauguration of the CPC pipeline, Kazakhstan dropped its interest in the project.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46016915070896\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Kazakhstan-China pipeline<\/h4><p id=\"idm46016915195952\">Kazakhstan\u2019s need to diversify its oil export directions matched with China\u2019s goals to ensure the security of its energy supplies. Central Asia is China\u2019s nearest neighbour, from where China could build direct pipeline links without paying transit fees to third countries. In 1997, the governments of China and Kazakhstan reached an agreement on building a pipeline between the two countries. It has been announced that the countries agreed to invest jointly in the construction of the pipeline; however, the share of each party in financing the pipeline was not revealed.<sup id=\"xref57\"><a href=\"#fn57\">57<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm46016915194144\">However, the construction was delayed due to the financial crisis in 1997\u20131998. In addition, the low oil prices undermined economic feasibility of the project. Kazakhstan was concerned with delays in the construction as President Nazarbayev in 1998 fired Deputy Prime Minister Akhmetzhan Yessimov reportedly for failing to speed-up the start of the pipeline construction. Nazarbayev commented about the project: \u201cI will personally oversee the pipeline construction. The agreement is of utmost importance. All the issues have to be dealt without delay.\u201d<sup id=\"xref58\"><a href=\"#fn58\">58<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm46016915198832\">With the difficulties in securing the financing, the project was shelved in 1999. The project participants attempted to seek IFO\u2019s financial support but without success. China expressed suspicion that the U.S. influenced IFO not to support the pipeline project.<sup id=\"xref59\"><a href=\"#fn59\">59<\/a><\/sup> In the end, following the recovery of the oil prices in the 2000s, the Sino-Kazakh pipeline project became feasible and the construction resumed.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016915197056\">The pipeline became China\u2019s first direct import route, which eased Beijing\u2019s concerns about the dependence on imports from the Middle East through the U.S.-controlled Strait of Malacca. At the time of completion, it was the longest existing pipeline with the length of 2,228\u00a0km. To the date, the export volumes of Kazakh oil through this pipeline are not considerable. For example, in 2013, Kazakhstan\u2019s crude exports via Kazakhstan-China pipeline constituted 224 thousand b\/d, which is 16% of total exports.<sup id=\"xref60\"><a href=\"#fn60\">60<\/a><\/sup> Nevertheless, it is planned that oil from newly launched Kashagan project will contribute to increased exports in this direction.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46016911793424\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Summary<\/h4><p id=\"idm46016911792624\">Although it may seem that Kazakhstan had numerous pipeline options to choose from, this was not the case in the early 1990s. The proposed \u201cWestern route,\u201d <i>i.e.<\/i>, the Trans-Caspian oil pipeline, was effectively blocked by Russian and Iranian objections. The \u201cSouthern Route\u201d was not an option due to the U.S. opposition against building a pipeline traversing Iranian territory. The U.S.-based oil multinationals and IFOs were unable to invest in any pipeline in this direction, and even in case if such pipeline was constructed, the companies in Kazakhstan would not be able to deliver oil in this direction. Therefore, at the beginning of the 1990s, Kazakhstan had only a few options, amongst which the CPC pipeline through Russia was the most prominent.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016915026064\">To date, Kazakhstan still heavily relies on a partnership with Russia on exporting its oil and gas to global markets. Overall, the country sends 85% of its crude exports and 99.5% of its gas exports in the Northern direction. For example, in 2014, the CPC pipeline alone delivered more than half of Kazakhstan\u2019s exports, which is 35.2\u00a0million tonnes of total Kazakhstan\u2019s 67\u00a0million tonne exports. According to Kazakhstan\u2019s Energy Minister Vladimir Shkolnik, the CPC pipeline will be further expanded to carry up to 67\u00a0million tonnes of crude by 2016.<sup id=\"xref61\"><a href=\"#fn61\">61<\/a><\/sup> This indicates Kazakhstan\u2019s commitment to continue to rely on the CPC in exporting its crude to world markets. Another line to Russia, the Atyrau-Samara delivered 14.6\u00a0million tonnes of oil, whereas additional 2.3\u00a0million tonnes were sent to Russia via rail transportation.<sup id=\"xref62\"><a href=\"#fn62\">62<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm46016915076256\">Nevertheless, the government indicated that Kazakhstan would need more than one main export route in order to diversify risks. When the Chinese energy consumer market opened in the end of the 1990s, Kazakhstan was eager to build both oil and gas pipelines to China. As the plans for the construction of the Trans-Caspian pipeline have not realised, Kazakhstan moved to develop transportation of oil across the Sea by tankers. In November 2008, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan reached an agreement on the development of the Trans-Caspian oil transport system (TCOTS) to connect East Caspian oil fields with the BTC pipeline. The two countries agreed to create a joint venture, which will regulate a transport system in the Sea and a fleet of barges and tankers. It is projected that once in full operation, the TCOTS will carry up to 500,000 barrels of crude daily, with a potential future capacity of 1.2\u00a0million\u00a0b\/d.<sup id=\"xref63\"><a href=\"#fn63\">63<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm46016915074112\">In the end, Kazakhstan managed to construct and diversify its oil export routes only in the second decade after obtaining its independence. The country managed to construct two major oil pipelines and two gas exporting pipelines to deliver its hydrocarbons to the world markets. The competition between the U.S., Russia and China had been beneficial for Kazakhstan in this regard, as each of the powers advocated different routes and provided support and financing for construction of new pipelines.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016915052768\">Moreover, Kazakhstan put significant efforts in strengthening the competitiveness of its domestic national oil company Kazmunaigas. With the founding of Kazmunaigas in 2002, one the government\u2019s main priorities in petroleum industry was to increase Kazakhstan\u2019s participation in energy projects. Since then, Kazmunaigas acquired 10% stake in Karachaganak and 16.81% stake in Kashagan projects. The existing legislation vested the NOC with a right to acquire at least 50% stake in any new hydrocarbon development project.<sup id=\"xref64\"><a href=\"#fn64\">64<\/a><\/sup> In conformity with this objective, the state bounded IOCs to enter into the \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d with Kazmunaigas. Thus, any foreign investor in Kazakhstan\u2019s oil and gas sector was \u201cforced to work in one way or another\u201d<sup id=\"xref65\"><a href=\"#fn65\">65<\/a><\/sup> with the NOC. Overall, the creation of consolidated national company strengthened the bargaining position of Kazakhstan vis-\u00e0-vis foreign investors.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46016913963392\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Turkmenistan\u2019s options<\/h3><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46016913962624\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">The Russian route for Turkmen gas exports<\/h4><p id=\"idm46016913961856\">Before 1991, Turkmenistan was a part of the unified Soviet pipeline system. Like Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan had to rely on Russian pipeline system to export its natural gas abroad. The country\u2019s main \u201cwindow\u201d for gas exports was the Central Asia-Centre (CAC) pipeline, which was constructed during the Soviet times. The pipeline traverses from Turkmenistan through Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan before plugging into the Russian pipeline network. Therefore, the country\u2019s gas exports almost entirely relied on the Gazprom-controlled gas pipeline. However, the problem with the CAC pipeline was that it has outlived its term. The construction of the first section of the pipeline dates as far as to the 1960s. In addition, the pipeline has a limited capacity to export only about 44\u00a0bcm of natural gas per year.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016913960560\">In 2007, Turkmenistan, Russia and Kazakhstan agreed to upgrade the CAC, but Moscow and Ashgabat could not achieve a consensus on the route of the pipeline. Turkmenistan insisted that the new line should connect its largest fields with gas terminals in the Caspian Sea so that it could reach international markets. Russia was reluctant and insisted that the pipeline should follow the old route. As parties could not come to an agreement, the CAC renovation project halted. Nevertheless, Turkmenistan had not abandoned its plans to deliver its gas to the Caspian coast, and between 2012 and 2015, it completed the construction of its own domestic East-West pipeline.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016915063888\">During the 1990s, Russia has not proved to be a reliable partner for Turkmenistan as exports through the CAC repeatedly interrupted. Gazprom naturally gave preference to its own gas to supply the European market, and Turkmenistan found itself competing with the former Soviet counterpart. In 1997, Russia discontinued importing Turkmen gas, which seriously affected the economy of the Central Asian state. Also, Turkmenistan was not particularly happy with Russia\u2019s inability to pay with hard cash. Instead, Russia paid by goods according to barter agreements, while Turkmenistan needed to generate foreign currency to rehabilitate its economy. The above-mentioned difficulties pushed Turkmenistan to search for alternative ways to export its natural gas.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46016915062320\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">The Iranian route for Turkmen gas exports<\/h4><p id=\"idm46016915061552\">Turkmenistan\u2019s nearest market is the Persian Gulf, which prompted Ashgabat to build relations with Iran. In 1997, the two countries launched a 200-km gas pipeline, which traverses from Turkmen city of Korpeje to Iranian gas distribution system at Kurtkui. However, the volumes of gas transported through this line remained modest.<sup id=\"xref66\"><a href=\"#fn66\">66<\/a><\/sup> In addition to this, in late 1990s, Turkmenistan concluded a swap deal with Iran on supplies of 50,000\u00a0b\/d of oil.<sup id=\"xref67\"><a href=\"#fn67\">67<\/a><\/sup> In 2010, the Dauletabad-Khangiran gas pipeline was inaugurated, potentially adding another 12\u00a0bcm per year to Turkmenistan\u2019s gas exports to Iran.<sup id=\"xref68\"><a href=\"#fn68\">68<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm46016914840480\">Despite this cooperation between the two countries, Turkmenistan still does not have direct pipeline outlet to the Persian Gulf. Although this route is the most convenient and economical way to send oil and gas abroad, the U.S. strongly discouraged Ashgabat from dealing with Iran. Turkmenistan could build a pipeline on its own as it was not bound by the foreign investment and no Western company works in the country\u2019s major energy projects. However, the construction of such pipeline requires substantial financing, which Turkmenistan was not able to provide.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016915059072\">Cautious about the possibility of implementation of the \u201cSouthern route,\u201d the U.S. expressed readiness to support Ashgabat in building the Trans-Caspian gas (TCGP) pipeline. Turkmenistan\u2019s president explicitly stated in one of his interviews that the U.S. government \u201cstands behind\u201d the TCGP project.<sup id=\"xref69\"><a href=\"#fn69\">69<\/a><\/sup> The President of the U.S. Export-Import Bank James Harmon visited Turkmenistan in 1998 offering $3\u00a0billion for the construction of the pipeline from Turkmenbashi to Baku.<sup id=\"xref70\"><a href=\"#fn70\">70<\/a><\/sup> In July 1999, the special advisor to the U.S. President for Caspian energy John Wolf visited Turkmenistan and expressed Washington\u2019s support for the TCGP and stated that the pipeline is essential for strengthening the country\u2019s independence.<sup id=\"xref71\"><a href=\"#fn71\">71<\/a><\/sup> Shortly after this, in November 1999, leaders of Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Turkey and Georgia signed a memorandum of understanding on the project construction.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016915055312\">In the end, the TCGP project has not been materialised for a number of reasons. First, Russia and Iran warned Turkmenistan that no state could take a unilateral decision to build a pipeline across the Caspian seabed without the agreement of all five littoral states. In late 1999, Russia agreed to settle major gas disputes with Turkmenistan and offered cash payments for 40% of total Turkmen gas purchases.<sup id=\"xref72\"><a href=\"#fn72\">72<\/a><\/sup> Overall, Moscow agreed to buy 20\u00a0bcm of Turkmen gas annually, which was projected to increase to 50\u00a0bcm within five years.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016915240112\">Second, in July 1999, Azerbaijan discovered large deposits of natural gas in Shah Deniz field. Therefore, Azerbaijan preferred to send its own gas to Turkey and Europe, rather than helping Turkmenistan to plug into this market. The unsettled legal status of the Caspian Sea added complexity to the issue, as Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan have areas of overlapping claims in the Sea, for example, Kyapaz\/Serdar oil deposit. As no agreement was achieved on the Caspian Sea delimitation, bilateral relations between the two states worsened. In addition, Turkmenistan\u2019s leadership could not reach an understanding with the project developers Shell and PSG companies.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016915238800\">Another gas pipeline project Turkmenistan was considering is the Turkmenistan-Iran-Turkey-Europe gas pipeline, which was also supposed to traverse through Iranian territory. However, international financial organisations and foreign companies refused to provide financing, while Turkmenistan and Iran lacked finances to build on their own.<sup id=\"xref73\"><a href=\"#fn73\">73<\/a><\/sup> The circumstances changed in the post-2010 period, as the Russian-Ukrainian crisis repeatedly interrupted Russian gas supplies to Europe and the EU expressed renewed interest in importing Turkmen gas.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914839904\">In the light of recent developments, the EU became more active in lobbying the Trans-Caspian project, which is illustrated by the visit of the Vice President of the European Commission Maros Sefcovic to Turkmenistan in May 2015. Following the negotiations with the Turkmen government, the EU declared that Brussels and Ashgabat have reached \u201cmutual understanding\u201d about the cooperation on the project.<sup id=\"xref74\"><a href=\"#fn74\">74<\/a><\/sup> It is planned that Turkmenistan will deliver its first gas to Europe by 2019. With the sanctions relieved from Iran in 2015, there is an increased possibility that Turkmenistan-Europe link will traverse through Iranian territory, rather than crossing the Caspian Sea.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46016914837296\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Asian routes for Turkmenistan<\/h4><p id=\"idm46016914836528\">In April 2006, Turkmenistan and China reached an agreement on the construction of the natural gas pipeline. The pipeline was to become part of the Central Asia-China pipeline, which supplies China with natural gas from Central Asian states. As part of the agreement, Beijing undertook the construction costs, whereas Turkmenistan promised to ensure long-term gas supplies for the pipeline. The new export route was vital for Turkmenistan because it ended Russian monopolistic position as the major buyer of Turkmen gas. Following this, Turkmenistan managed to re-negotiate gas export deals with Moscow as the latter agreed to increase payments for gas from $65 to $100 per thousand cubic metres.<sup id=\"xref75\"><a href=\"#fn75\">75<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm46016914834608\">However, shortly after the agreement was signed, the natural gas prices decreased substantially. Russia expressed its unwillingness to pay the price, which was higher than the average price in the European market. In April 2009, the CAC pipeline was damaged by the explosion, which interrupted Turkmen gas supplies in northern direction until January 2010. As the blast happened in the Russian section, Turkmenistan perceived this with suspicion. The gas trade cooperation between Moscow and Ashkhabad has worsened over time, and Turkmenistan\u2019s gas supplies to its northern neighbour plummeted from about 45\u00a0bcm in 2008 to just 4\u00a0bcm in 2015.<sup id=\"xref76\"><a href=\"#fn76\">76<\/a><\/sup><\/p><p id=\"idm46016914615648\">With the deterioration of Turkmenistan\u2019s energy cooperation with Russia, the launch of the Central Asia-China pipeline in 2009 was timely. Since then, Turkmenistan became one of China\u2019s largest gas suppliers. More than half of the Turkmen gas exports were delivered to China by 2012.<sup id=\"xref77\"><a href=\"#fn77\">77<\/a><\/sup> In his visit to Turkmenistan in September 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping launched the production at Galkynysh field, which is the second biggest gas find in the world. The development of this deposit will enable Turkmenistan to triple its gas exports to China.<sup id=\"xref78\"><a href=\"#fn78\">78<\/a><\/sup> The Central Asia-China pipeline could be extended in the future, eventually connecting Japan to the new energy network.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914612672\">Another gas export route Turkmenistan was considering in the direction to South Asia is named the TAPI pipeline. The pipeline would connect Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, giving the project its abbreviation name TAPI. The American company UNOCAL proposed to build the pipeline, while the Asian Development Bank offered the financing. The project received support from the U.S. because it prevents Iran from building the pipeline in this direction.<sup id=\"xref79\"><a href=\"#fn79\">79<\/a><\/sup> Hoping that the ruling regime in Afghanistan will help to construct such a pipeline, Washington attempted to negotiate with Taliban.<sup id=\"xref80\"><a href=\"#fn80\">80<\/a><\/sup> However, the extremely unstable political situation in Afghanistan made it impossible to move on with the construction and the implementation was frozen although the media reported several attempts by the governments to reanimate the project.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016915213184\">Finally, the TAPI project was revitalised in 2015 and the construction of the pipeline started in Turkmenistan. With the building costs of the pipeline estimated around $10\u00a0billion, the parties aim to commission the pipeline by 2018.<sup id=\"xref81\"><a href=\"#fn81\">81<\/a><\/sup> Interviewed experts commented<sup id=\"xref82\"><a href=\"#fn82\">82<\/a><\/sup> that considering the low energy prices and difficult economic situation in most energy exporting countries, the timely completion of the project is unlikely.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46016915170784\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Summary<\/h4><p id=\"idm46016915169984\">In its foreign policy, Turkmenistan declared its policy of \u201cpositive neutrality\u201d or \u201cpermanent neutrality\u201d to all other countries, which was recognised by the UN in 1995. Although Turkmenistan became a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and few other organisations in the beginning of 1990s, it consistently avoided joining any major regional economic or security organisations. The country refused to enter regional organisations such as the CIS Collective Security Council or the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. This, however, does not mean that Turkmenistan completely isolated itself from the world. The country\u2019s foreign policy is primarily focused on maintaining positive bilateral relations with its main trade partners such as Russia, China, Iran and Kazakhstan.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016915168720\">One can argue that Turkmenistan had more choices than Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan in diversifying its export lines. The first option was to upgrade the \u201cNorthern\u201d route to Russia although the disagreements with Gazprom remained unresolved. Even though the country is not bound by the Western investment, Turkmenistan has not managed to build a pipeline through Iran to the Persian Gulf. Neither the plans to build a connection to European markets materialised. The South-East direction remained attractive but was constantly delayed due to the instability in neighbouring Afghanistan. Therefore, despite the availability of several options, Ashgabat remained dependent on exports to Russia for almost two decades after independence. Only with the inauguration of the Central Asia-China pipeline in 2009, the country managed to diversify its gas exports.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016915167216\">Turkmenistan\u2019s slow development with the export diversification can be partially explained by the absence of foreign investors in the country. The Turkmen government attempted to attract investment to build pipelines to Europe and East Asia, but international investors and financial organisations refused to provide funding. In contrast, in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, foreign multinationals initiated and pushed for the construction of new export routes, influencing the local and home governments to cooperate on the pipeline projects. Oil multinationals in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have been able to attract financial support both from their respective governments and from financial institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016915166016\">It is clear from analysing the media reports that Turkmenistan\u2019s leadership understands the need for multiple natural gas export directions. With the further increase in gas production, the country will attempt to diversify its export routes further. Whether it will be in the Western or Southern directions is not clear. If increasingly active involvement of the EU in negotiating future pipeline projects with Turkmenistan will bring results, Turkmenistan-Europe line could become to be the next connection.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46016914909008\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Competition for energy resources of the Caspian basin: The new \u201cGreat Game\u201d or the new \u201cSilk Road\u201d?<\/h3><p id=\"idm46016914908112\">Although one cannot deny the intense rivalry for Caspian energy reserves, the analogy with the \u201cGreat Game\u201d is not adequate. There are several crucial differences between the 19th century\u2019s rivalry and modern processes in the region. First, the \u201cold\u201d game was for the possession of the territories in Central Asia, whereas the \u201cnew\u201d game involves a struggle for control over the energy resources of the Caspian basin. Moreover, the old Great Game involved two main players, namely, British and Russian empires, whereas the modern competition for Caspian resources involved multiple actors such as the global power (the U.S., Russia and China) and regional players (Iran, Turkey and the Caspian littoral states).<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914906928\">Second, the notion of the Great Game perceived as a zero-sum game cannot be applied to the processes in the Caspian region. In the case of the Caspian energy resources, it has been demonstrated that the energy cooperation was beneficial for both exporters and importers of oil and gas. Moreover, the global powers cooperate with each other in numerous joint ventures such as Kashagan project in Kazakhstan, and the South Caucasus pipeline consortium where, for example, Iranian and Western companies are members. In another set of examples, the U.S. companies collaborated with Russia in order to build the CPC pipeline.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914905840\">Finally, and most importantly, the Great Game concept presupposes that the territories where the Game is taking place have little or no impact on the outcome. However, same cannot be said about the NIC states, as in many cases, their strategic moves predetermined the dynamics of the processes. The governments in the NIC countries made strategic decisions on whether to rebuild the relationship with Russia or to ally with the West. For example, Azerbaijan chose the partnership with the U.S. and the European Union and approved the BTC, which is part of the U.S.-endorsed Caspian Energy Corridor initiative. In the end, all three NIC states managed to wane Russian pipeline monopoly, which resulted in operation of new pipelines on a competitive basis.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914904432\">At the same time, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan remained cautious to cut their ties with Moscow, simultaneously attempting to maintain good relations with other external actors. Seeing the rapid growth of the South-Asian energy-consuming markets, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan moved to negotiate pipeline connections with China and India. In their foreign policies, Astana and Ashgabat followed similar multi-vector approach though with some differences. Since Turkmenistan does not share a border with Russia and geographically distanced from its former Soviet counterpart, the country experienced a less pressing need to cope with the Moscow\u2019s influence.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016915149936\">Furthermore, Turkmenistan could choose to limit foreign participation in its hydrocarbon sector and maintain state ownership of its main energy projects. In contrast, Kazakhstan conducted a pragmatic foreign policy, attempting not to favour any of the global powers at the expense of other. Kazakhstan\u2019s decision to sell its energy resources to Western and Chinese companies was motivated by the not only economic reasoning to generate revenue but also political motivation to balance the Russian influence. In the 1990s, Kazakhstan actively sought to attract Western foreign investment, whereas in the second decade after independence, the government counterbalanced the oil majors with Chinese oil multinationals.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016915148752\">There is no doubt that the major geopolitical players in the region greatly influenced the trajectories of the new pipeline routes. However, considering the improved influence and independence in the NIC states, the analogy of the \u201cGreat game\u201d may not be appropriate to describe the relationship between the Caspian states and global power poles such as the U.S., Russia and China. The NIC countries ceased to be passive players, which can be easily manipulated by external influence though they still had to balance the presence of geopolitical powers. In the end, both Caspian energy producers and energy importers have benefitted from the diversification of pipeline routes in the region. The new pipelines connected the Caspian region with Europe in the West and China in the East.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016915147504\">In terms of theoretical implications of this article\u2019s findings, applying the narrative of the Great Game, which focuses almost exclusively on actors pursuing power does not seem to be appropriate in analysing international relations in the Caspian region. The classical school of political realism to which the Great Game framework largely belongs draws excessive attention on competitive and conflictual features of the interstate relations. As a result, the reliance on realist framework in analysing Central Asian region, and more broadly Post-Soviet countries, has led to an overemphasis of self-interest and power relations, overlooking mutual benefits and cooperation between the local and external actors.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016915146320\">Although the realist theory provides a useful framework for the analysis of interstate relations in the region, application of the liberalist theory in conjunction with it seems to be more appropriate in this regard. The relevant feature of the liberalist approach is in that it accentuates coexistence, collaboration and mutual benefits of actors. Therefore, the processes in the Caspian and the Central Asian region could be analysed through the framework of the New Silk Road. In this context, competition, trade and cooperation would be considered as the main drivers behind the development of energy projects in the region. The energy trade links that the NIC countries have built during the two decades of independence have paved the way for the formation of the New Silk Road, which stretches from Europe to China and the Caspian region being the indispensable link between the two.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46016915144800\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Conclusion<\/h3><p id=\"idm46016914903792\">While the NIC states aimed to increase their hydrocarbon exports as rapidly as possible, the main obstacle for multiplying the production output was the lack of export routes. The necessity of diversified pipeline routes was predetermined by geography, economics and politics in the Caspian region. Alternative pipelines make the NIC countries less dependent on any transit country or customer, while at the same time ensuring safeguards against political shocks such as change of the regime in a neighbouring country, worsening of bilateral relations or damage of the pipeline route as a consequence of conflict or terrorist attacks.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914995360\">This article demonstrated that the competition for energy resources and security of supplies from the Caspian region shaped the pipeline trajectories. The new pipelines connected the Caspian region with Europe in the West and with China in the East. Competition, trade and cooperation were the primary drivers behind the development of pipeline projects in the region. Eventually, both Caspian energy producers and energy importers have benefitted from the diversification of pipeline routes in the region.<\/p><p id=\"idm46016914994384\">In the end, none of the pipeline projects proved to be problem free. Although serious confrontation or military action did not take place, there had been an intense rivalry amongst geopolitical powers. The fact that commercial interests came into conflict with strategic interests suggests that pipelines can offer more than just transit fees. Hence, for transit countries, the successful bid for having a new pipeline through their territory meant not only economic but also political rewards. Pipelines symbolise a link, through which countries are not only bounded together and communicate but also influence each other to a certain extent.<\/p><\/div><\/div><div id=\"article-back\" class=\"back\"><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46016914992640\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Competing interests<\/h3><p id=\"idm46016914991536\">Serik Orazgaliyev declares that he has no conflict of interest.<\/p><\/div><h3 class=\"main-title\">Funding sources<\/h3><p>None.<\/p><div class=\"back-section\"><a id=\"idm46016914990928\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Footnotes<\/h3><div class=\"reference-container\" id=\"fn1\"><div><div class=\"pull-left\"><strong><span class=\"generated\">1<\/span><\/strong><\/div><div class=\"ref-content\">Ian Cuthbertson, \u201cThe new \u2018Great Game\u2019,\u201d <i>World Policy Journal<\/i>, 1994, 11 (4): 31\u201343;

Over the last few years, there were quite a few theoretical and experimental demonstrations of acoustic cloaks, which typically operate based on either transformation acoustics [<a href=\"#fn03\" id=\"xref03\">3<\/a>\u2013<a href=\"#fn05\" id=\"xref05\">5<\/a>] or scattering cancellation [<a href=\"#fn06\" id=\"xref06\">6<\/a>] designs. In addition to these \u201cpassive\u201d designs, active cloaks, which use sound sources to cancel the incident wave are also being considered [<a href=\"#fn07\" id=\"xref07\">7<\/a>]. Unfortunately, transformation acoustic 3D and ground plane cloaks are difficult to implement in many situations since limitations on the material parameters of the cloak lead to typical cloak dimensions being of the same order of magnitude as the cloaked region itself. Such an acoustic cloak would not be easy or practical to wear as a helmet if an application is sought in which a human head needs to be protected against an incoming intense acoustic wave front or a very loud sound. While this problem may be partially overcome with a scattering cancellation cloak, which typically requires a thinner shell around the cloaked object (compared to the transformation cloak), the scattering cancellation cloaks are designed to cancel the scattered wave in the near- and far-field outside the coated object, while they do not protect the inner cloak volume from the incoming wave. Here, we report that these shortcomings of the existing acoustic cloaking technologies may be overcome using ultralightweight acoustic metamaterials exhibiting \u201cinfinite cylinder-like\u201d or \u201ccylindrical\u201d dispersion. These cylindrical acoustic metamaterials may be implemented in a design of an ultrathin and ultralightweight acoustic cloak, which combines scattering cancellation in the far-field with efficient sound proofing of the inner cloak volume. Potential applications of our design may include combat helmet and body armor, which may provide considerable protection of brain and lung tissues against harmful effects of intense sound and ultrasound waves and wave fronts.<\/p><p id=\"idm140077889530976\">Our design is based on an acoustic metamaterial, which has cylindrical dispersion, as illustrated in <a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1a<\/a>.

In the limit <i>c<\/i><sub><i>z<\/i><\/sub><i>&lt;&lt;c<\/i><sub><i>xy<\/i><\/sub>, the surface of equal frequency of phonons in the momentum space may be approximated as a cylindrical surface. Similar to layered (hyperbolic) electromagnetic metamaterials [<a href=\"#fn08\" id=\"xref08\">8<\/a>], this limit corresponds to a topological phase transition, so that the acoustic metamaterial behavior becomes quite unusual. Based on the Fermat principle, sound waves in such a material tend to propagate mostly in the xy plane. A practical implementation of such a metamaterial (<a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1b<\/a>) may be based on thin layers of polyvinyl chloride (PVC, <i>c<\/i><sub><i>pvc<\/i><\/sub> = 1,414\u00a0m\/s) [<a href=\"#fn09\" id=\"xref09\">9<\/a>] separated by the layers of silica aerogel [<a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"xref10\">10<\/a>], which typically has much lower sound velocity of the order of <i>c<\/i><sub><i>a<\/i><\/sub>~ 50 to 100\u00a0m\/s and extremely low density <i>\u03c1<\/i><sub><i>a<\/i><\/sub>~100\u00a0kg\/m<sup>3<\/sup>.

Silica aerogels are known to have excellent soundproofing properties on their own [<a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"xref11\">11<\/a>] due to considerable sound propagation losses. However, our theoretical simulations (<a href=\"#F2\">Figure 2<\/a>) and test experiments clearly demonstrate that in accordance with the Fermat principle, a layered cylindrical acoustic metamaterial structure indeed has considerably improved soundproofing properties compared to the bulk aerogels. The measured transmission of the fabricated 2\u2009mm thick metamaterial sample which consists of 6 layers of 10 \u03bcm thick PVC film separated by layers of silica aerogel appears to be 9.2\u00b710<sup>\u22124<\/sup> at 39.7\u00a0kHz, which is ~12 times smaller than the transmission of the same thickness of the bulk aerogel.<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F2\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/02ea42dd-4f25-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/quis_facere_sint_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/02ea42dd-4f25-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/quis_facere_sint_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/02ea42dd-4f25-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/FNAN-00007-2017-02_F0002.png\" download=\"FNAN-00007-2017-02_F0002.png\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 2 - Aerogel-based acoustic metamaterials.<\/p><div class=\"fig-description\"><i>(a) Comparison of sound wave propagation through bulk aerogel (<i>left<\/i>) and the multilayer PVC\/aerogel metamaterial (<i>right<\/i>) of the same thickness.

These cloaks were designed to protect a 15-cm-diameter cylinder made of material with density <i>\u03c1<\/i><sub><i>w<\/i><\/sub> = 1,000\u00a0kg\/m<sup>3<\/sup> and the speed of sound <i>c<\/i><sub><i>w<\/i><\/sub> = 1,500\u00a0m\/s (a water-filled thin glass cylinder), which is placed in air. It is assumed that the average material parameters of a human head would also not deviate strongly from these values. The idea of our acoustic scattering cancellation cloak is similar to the operation principle of the scattering cancellation invisibility cloak [<a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"xref12\">12<\/a>], which is based on compensation of the positive polarizability <i>~(\u025b<\/i>-1<i>)V<\/i><sub><i>d<\/i><\/sub> of a dielectric particle using a metal or metamaterial shell having negative polarizability (<i>\u025b<\/i>&lt;1) and the appropriate volume <i>V<\/i><sub><i>m<\/i><\/sub>. Since the speed of sound in silica aerogel <i>c<\/i><sub><i>a<\/i><\/sub> is smaller than the speed of sound in air (<i>c<\/i><sub><i>0<\/i><\/sub> = 343\u00a0m\/s, <i>\u03c1<\/i><sub><i>0<\/i><\/sub> = 1.225\u00a0kg\/m<sup>3<\/sup>), aerogel may be used to create a scattering cancellation cloak for a water cylinder in air, which would be somewhat similar to the operation of the electromagnetic cloak (since the speed of sound in water is larger than the speed of sound in air). However, we should point out that such an acoustic \u201cnegative polarizability\u201d is useful but not necessary in the acoustic cloak design. Extensive work in the literature has shown that careful design and control of the density and bulk modulus (and shear modulus, in the case of elastic materials) all significantly affect the ability to achieve scattering cancellation and may alleviate the need for \u201cnegative polarizability.\u201d<\/p><p id=\"idm140077889586432\">These alternative possibilities notwithstanding the guiding principle of our design was an approximate mutual compensation of the \u201cacoustic polarizabilities\u201d of the component materials integrated over the volume of the cloak, followed by numerical fine tuning of the geometrical parameters of the cloak through scattering minimization. This numerical fine tuning was achieved by minimizing the scattering of a cloaked cylinder obtained by solving the 2D acoustic wave equation<\/p><div class=\"disp-formula\"><a id=\"E2\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><math display=\"block\"><mrow><mo>\u2207<\/mo><mo>\u22c5<\/mo><mrow><mo>(<\/mo><mrow><mfrac><mn>1<\/mn><mi>\u03c1<\/mi><\/mfrac><mo>\u2207<\/mo><mi>p<\/mi><\/mrow><mo>)<\/mo><\/mrow><mo>\u2212<\/mo><mfrac><mrow><msubsup><mi>k<\/mi><mrow><mi>e<\/mi><mi>q<\/mi><\/mrow><mn>2<\/mn><\/msubsup><mi>p<\/mi><\/mrow><mi>\u03c1<\/mi><\/mfrac><mo>=<\/mo><mn>0<\/mn><\/mrow><\/math><div>(2)<\/div><\/div><p id=\"idm140077889618672\">where<\/p><div class=\"disp-formula\"><a id=\"E3\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><math display=\"block\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>k<\/mi><mrow><mi>e<\/mi><mi>q<\/mi><\/mrow><mn>2<\/mn><\/msubsup><mo>=<\/mo><mfrac><mrow><msup><mi>\u03c9<\/mi><mn>2<\/mn><\/msup><\/mrow><mrow><msup><mi>c<\/mi><mn>2<\/mn><\/msup><\/mrow><\/mfrac><mo>\u2212<\/mo><msubsup><mi>k<\/mi><mi>z<\/mi><mn>2<\/mn><\/msubsup><\/mrow><\/math><div>(3)<\/div><\/div><p id=\"idm140077889647200\">and <i>p<\/i> is the acoustic pressure, using the acoustic module of COMSOL Multiphysics 4.2a solver. Our simulation results are presented in <a href=\"#F3\">Figure 3<\/a>. The scattering of a 6\u2009kHz sound wave by an uncloaked 15\u2009cm diameter cylinder shown in <a href=\"#F3\">Figure 3a<\/a> produces considerable reflection and shadow. In addition, resonant enhancement of the sound wave can be observed inside the cylinder. Both reflection and shadow is considerably reduced in <a href=\"#F3\">Figure 3b<\/a>, which was obtained by numerical optimization of the thin aerogel layer around the cylinder. The resonant enhancement inside the cylinder is also reduced. However, considerable \u201chot spots\u201d of sound intensity may be still seen inside the cloaked cylinder. As we have mentioned above, such \u201chot spots\u201d are bound to appear since the conventional scattering cancellation cloaks are designed to reduce the far-field scattering only. Finally, when the multilayer PVC\/aerogel metamaterial is implemented (<a href=\"#F3\">Figure 3c<\/a>), the far-field cloaking performance remains almost intact, while the sound intensity inside the cloak now stays near zero everywhere inside the cloaked cylinder. Thus, such a cloak combines scattering cancellation in the far-field with efficient soundproofing of the inner cloak volume, which is clearly evidenced by the comparison in <a href=\"#F3\">Figure 3d<\/a> of the scattered field shown in the logarithmic scale from the cloaked and uncloaked cylinders. The left image in <a href=\"#F3\">Figure 3d<\/a> also illustrates the effect of material losses on the cloaking performance of our design. This image shows simulated performance of the cloak in which the aerogel losses are turned off numerically, with no apparent deterioration of performance.<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F3\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/02ea42dd-4f25-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/quia_pariatur_ut_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/02ea42dd-4f25-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/quia_pariatur_ut_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/02ea42dd-4f25-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/FNAN-00007-2017-02_F0003.png\" download=\"FNAN-00007-2017-02_F0003.png\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 3 - Cloaking properties of aerogel-based acoustic metamaterials.<\/p><div class=\"fig-description\"><i>a) Scattering of a 6\u00a0kHz sound wave by an uncloaked 15\u00a0cm diameter water-filled cylinder calculated using COMSOL Multiphysics 4.2a.

The acoustic cloak response to this shock wave is calculated as FFT<sup>\u22121<\/sup>(C(\u03bd)*FFT(P(t))), where P(t) is the pressure profile in a shock wave, FFT is the Fast Fourier transformation, and C(\u03bd) is the calculated frequency response of the acoustic cloak obtained from our COMSOL Multiphysics simulations. It appears that the cloak suppresses <img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"\"\/> in its interior by at least a factor of 100. These results are further verified in <a href=\"#F5\">Figure 5<\/a>, which shows the comparison of the simulated 7\u2009kHz pulse propagation through an uncloaked and cloaked cylinders. Note that the frequency range of numerical simulations using COMSOL Multiphysics was chosen to match spectral characteristics of a typical blast wave. As illustrated by <a href=\"#F4\">Figure 4<\/a>, the pressure rise time in a typical blast wave is a fraction of a millisecond. The goal of numerical simulations was to illustrate applicability of our approach for a human head protection against effects of a blast wave.<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F4\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/02ea42dd-4f25-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/officia_ratione_aut_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/02ea42dd-4f25-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/officia_ratione_aut_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/02ea42dd-4f25-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/FNAN-00007-2017-02_F0004.png\" download=\"FNAN-00007-2017-02_F0004.png\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 4 - Modeling of acoustic cloak response to a typical shock wave.<\/p><div class=\"fig-description\"><i>The original acoustic shock wave profile P(t) is taken from measurements reported in [<a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"xref13\">13<\/a>].

The motion sensor transmits a burst of 16 ultrasonic pulses with a frequency of about 49\u00a0kHz. The ultrasonic pulses reflect off a target and return to the face of the sensor. After the transducer detects an echo, the sensor measures the time between the trigger rising edge and the echo rising edge. It uses this time and the speed of sound in air to calculate the distance to the object. As shown in <a href=\"#F7\">Figure 7a<\/a>, the motion sensor is able to detect an uncloaked beaker located at a distance of 0.31\u00a0m in front of the sensor using ultrasonic pulses reflection off the beaker. On the other hand, when the beaker is cloaked and placed in the same location (see <a href=\"#F7\">Figure 7b<\/a>), the sensor cannot detect the presence of the cloaked beaker. It measures 3.16-m distance to a distant wall instead.

The cloaking behavior is broadband, so that it appears to be highly suitable in combat helmet and body armor applications, in which considerable protection of brain and lung tissues against harmful effects of intense sound and ultrasound waves may be provided.<\/p><p id=\"idm140077889609712\">We should also note that our technique follows in the footsteps of numerous important contributions to the field of acoustic cloaking, such as previous experimental results on scattering cancellation in air [<a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"xref14\">14<\/a>,<a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"xref15\">15<\/a>], and on the effect of absorption on a multilayer acoustic cloak [<a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"xref16\">16<\/a>]. We should also mention previous study on thin acoustic cloaking using scattering cancellation and hybrid designs [<a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"xref17\">17<\/a>,<a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"xref18\">18<\/a>], as well as various implementations of highly anisotropic multilayered metamaterial structures [<a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"xref19\">19<\/a>]. However, our choice of aerogel in the implementation of the layered acoustic metamaterials is critical, and it has not been studied previously. This choice enables very important practical applications due to the fact that the resulting cloaking designs are easily wearable since they are extremely light and thin.<\/p><\/div><div id=\"article-back\" class=\"back\"><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm140077889538704\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Competing interests<\/h3><p id=\"idm140077889660944\">Igor Smolyaninov declares that he has no conflict of interest.

The dynamics of blades with UPDs is nonlinear and the analysis is challenging from both the experimental and the numerical point of view. A key point in obtaining a predictive numerical tool is the choice of the correct contact parameters (contact stiffness and friction coefficient) that are required as input to the contact model. The paper presents different approaches to choose these parameters: the contact stiffness in normal and tangential direction are both calculated and measured. The calculation is based on the analytical models in literature, the measurements are carried out on a dedicated test rig. The friction coefficient is also measured. Test results of the forced response of the same bladed disk with UPDs are available for each blade, they come from an experimental campaign under controlled excitation and centrifugal force. The forced response of the bladed disk is not used as a mean to tune the contact parameters, but rather as a validation tool: the effect of the different choices of contact parameters in the code is highlighted by the comparison of the calculated and experimental forced response of the bladed disk.<\/p>\n<\/div>",

When the excitation frequency is close to a natural frequency of the system, within the engine speed working range, the vibration amplitude can lead to high-cycle fatigue failure. Friction damping devices such as UPDs are typically included into turbine design to limit these resonant vibrations (<a href=\"#fn03\" id=\"xref03\">Berruti et al., 2007<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn05\" id=\"xref05\">Berruti and Maschio, 2012<\/a>). Each damper is pressed against the blade platforms by the centrifugal force. When relative motion takes place between damper and blade platform, the generated nonlinear friction forces lead to the dissipation of vibrational energy. From an industrial point of view, it is fundamental to have effective tools for the design and performance prediction of UPDs. In the last 20\u00a0years different authors worked on this topic and proposed several numerical models, they can be found, among the others, in the papers by <a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"xref22\">Panning et al. (2004)<\/a>, <a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"xref26\">Petrov and Ewins (2007)<\/a>, <a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"xref11\">Cigeroglu et al. (2009)<\/a>, and <a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"xref14\">Firrone et al. (2009)<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p id=\"idm140695699568560\">The basic idea is that the calculation of the nonlinear forced response is performed by coupling the UPD to the blades modelled through FE. This coupling is achieved by inserting a contact element between blades and UPD. The contact element is characterized by four parameters, which must be chosen by the user: the friction coefficient, the normal contact stiffness and the tangential contact stiffness in two perpendicular directions.<\/p>\n<p id=\"idm140695699574560\">The problem of solving the nonlinear equation of the forced response in presence of contact forces, depending on the structure displacement, is nowadays completely overcome. The nonlinear forced response can be calculated with high computational efficiency in the frequency domain using the harmonic balance method (HBM) (<a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"xref23\">Petrov, 2004<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn09\" id=\"xref09\">Charleux et al., 2006<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"xref10\">Cigeroglu et al., 2007<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"xref24\">Petrov, 2007<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"xref14\">Firrone et al., 2009<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"xref27\">Siewert et al., 2009<\/a>; <a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"xref25\">Petrov, 2012<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p id=\"idm140695699457664\">Being the calculation method well-established, the still open question is how to choose the contact parameters (friction coefficient, normal and tangential contact stiffness) in order to obtain reliable predictions of the forced response. In literature contact parameters are usually tuned by matching the computed forced response function (FRF) with the measured one. This method, however is not a viable procedure at the design stage, where experimental FRFs are not yet available.<\/p>\n<p id=\"idm140695699466800\">This paper presents the numerical results obtained by a numerical code where the damper model, the contact model and the method for solving the equations are aligned with the state of the art. The attention is here focused on the procedure adopted for choosing contact parameters: only those procedures which do not rely on curve fitting between experimental and numerical FRFs are considered. The present paper adopts two such alternative ways to estimate contact parameters: the first is an established analytical model from the literature and the second is based on direct experimental measurements (<i>i.e.<\/i> hysteresis cycles) on UPDs on a dedicated test rig. The chosen test case is a bladed disk carrying cylindrical UPDs. The comparison between measured FRFs and simulated ones will highlight strengths and limitations of each method used for contact parameter estimation.<\/p>\n<div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm140695699469840\"><\/a> <!-- named anchor -->\n<h3 class=\"main-title\">Bladed disk with underplatform dampers<\/h3>\n<p id=\"idm140695699472608\">The test case analyzed in this paper is the bladed disk (blisk) shown in <a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1a<\/a>.

From the observation of the wear marks on the damper (as shown in <a href=\"#F10\">Figure 10a<\/a>) it was deduced that the contact was along all the contact line cylinder-platform. The contact nodes were then selected along a line on the platform as shown in <a href=\"#F10\">Figure 10b<\/a>. A contact model like that shown in <a href=\"#F2\">Figure 2a<\/a> was then applied to each contact node. The crucial point is the choice of the correct contact parameters since a wrong choice could lead to completely wrong results. As stated before the value of friction coefficient was assumed as 0.6 from previous measurements on a dedicated test rig (Lavella et al., 2013). The analytical set of contact stiffness assumed in the calculation is shown in the first row of <a href=\"#T2\"><span class=\"generated\">Table 2<\/span><\/a> . These contact stiffness values have still to be divided by the number of contact points. The value of k<sub>n<\/sub> in the first row of <a href=\"#T2\"><span class=\"generated\">Table 2<\/span><\/a> is calculated by applying <a href=\"#E13\"><span class=\"generated\">Equation 13<\/span><\/a> (<a href=\"#fn07\" id=\"xref07\">Br\u00e4ndlein et al., 1999<\/a>). The value of k<sub>tx<\/sub> and k<sub>ty<\/sub> were calculated according to Allara\u2019s flat punch model of <a href=\"#F4\">Figure 4<\/a>. The calculation of the contact stiffness values requires the value of the contact normal load.

On the other hand, if the contact stiffness values coming from the measurement (second row of <a href=\"#T2\"><span class=\"generated\">Table 2<\/span><\/a> ) are used as input in the calculation, the FRFs of <a href=\"#F13\">Figure 13<\/a> and <a href=\"#F14\">Figure 14<\/a> for the same two cases are obtained.<\/p>\n<div class=\"container-fluid img-container\">\n<div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F12\"><\/a>\n<div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/07f60111-25c9-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/velit_natus_aut_400.png\" \/><\/div>\n<div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/07f60111-25c9-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/velit_natus_aut_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"><\/i><\/span> Enlarge Image <\/a><br \/> <a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/07f60111-25c9-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JGPPS-00012-2017-01_F00012.tif\" download=\"JGPPS-00012-2017-01_F00012.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"><\/i><\/span> Download Image <\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 12 - Comparison between experimental and numerical FRFs.

The main difference is in the value of k<sub>tx<\/sub>. The measured value of k<sub>tx<\/sub> is one order of magnitude lower than that calculated analytically and it proves to be the correct value. The analytical method, which simulates a flat punch with a fillet radius pressed against a plane, is not fit to simulate a cylindrical contact since it gives a too high tangential contact stiffness value. This may be due to the fact that the method does not allow for micro-rotation or to the fact that it does not allow for variation of normal load. Both phenomena are instead encountered by the UPD during working condition.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm140695699855472\"><\/a> <!-- named anchor -->\n<h3 class=\"main-title\">Conclusions<\/h3>\n<p id=\"idm140695699854480\">The paper investigates two different ways to choose the contact stiffness values for the contact model of UPDs. Contact stiffness values can be derived from analytical modles available in literature (method 1) or they can be derived from measurements on a dedicated test rig with a laboratory damper, but with similar working conditions of the damper under study (method 2).<\/p>\n<p id=\"idm140695699853648\">The investigation is completed by the experimental\/numerical comparison of FRFs of a blisk with cylindrical UPDs. As mentioned above, numerical FRFs have been obtained using different contact stiffness values obtained with two different methodologies. It should be noted that in this paper experimental\/numerical comparison of FRFs is not used as a mean to tune the model, but as a separate and independent tool to evaluate different methods for contact parameter estimation.<\/p>\n<p id=\"idm140695699852704\">Regarding the normal contact stiffness k<sub>n<\/sub> the analytical calculation values (Br\u00e4ndlein, Harris, Allara) and the value derived from measurements on the laboratory damper agree. The small discrepancies between the obtained values have negligible effects over the forced response (<i>i.e.<\/i> well below the experimental FRF dispersion).<\/p>\n<p id=\"idm140695699851104\">Regarding the tangential contact stiffness k<sub>tx<\/sub> (in the plane perpendicular to the damper axis), Allara\u2019s analytical method (method 1) gives a value of the tangential contact stiffness k<sub>tx<\/sub> one order of magnitude higher than the value obtained by the derivation from measurements on the laboratory damper. In the calculation of the FRF this k<sub>tx<\/sub> value leads to a discrepancy &gt;50% between the measured and simulated peak frequency. Allara\u2019s analytical method, which simulates a flat punch with a fillet radius pressed against a plane, is clearly not fit to simulate a cylindrical contact. On the contrary, the method, based on direct measurements of k<sub>tx<\/sub> on a dedicated test rig with a laboratory damper (method 2) produces a value of k<sub>tx<\/sub> one order of magnitude lower than that calculated analytically. This value of measured k<sub>tx<\/sub>, given to the calculation code, was successful in producing matching numerical FRFs.<\/p>\n<p id=\"idm140695699847200\">In these authors opinion, the method was successful because the working conditions of the two dampers, the one tested on the dedicated test rig and the one under study, are comparable (same contact geometry, pressure, material and kinematics) and the data processing technique takes into account the difference of position and number of contact points.<\/p>\n<p id=\"idm140695699846384\">These authors are therefore confident on the determination of the contact stiffness, rather than through analytical model, though careful and direct measurements on dedicated test rigs.<\/p>\n<p id=\"idm140695699845728\">The results obtained here proved that measurements of contact stiffness on laboratory dampers under controlled conditions can be exported and used on other dampers.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"section\"><a

      "html": "<div id=\"article-body\" class=\"body\"><div class=\"tooltipRef\"><span>.<\/span><\/div><p class=\"first\" id=\"idm45643878570128\">It is pretty standard fare to argue that in fighting a successful war on terror, we shall have to compromise some of our values. And while this is not altogether correct, it is certainly more insightful and candid than the claims that really nothing needs to change which the very events of 9\/11 and its aftermath decisively refute. Nevertheless, this standard claim is wrong, but because it is wrong in a subtle, habitual way, it takes some analysis to get right.<\/p><p id=\"idm45643878569600\">First, let us begin with the celebrated \u201cspectrum\u201d view of human rights and powers of government that is so widely and unthinkingly held.<\/p><p id=\"idm45643878570256\">This is the view that our civil rights and civil liberties exist on an axis between the human rights on one end and the powers of government on the other; this view dominates our thinking these days. It was not always so. When Thomas Jefferson wrote that our people had inalienable rights whose protection was the purpose of government, he implicitly disavowed the spectrum metaphor. It would be a contradiction to say that the State required power \u2014 indeed could only justify the acquisition and exercise of power \u2014 to protect rights if this acquisition and exercise invariably diminished rights. Jefferson, like Alexander Hamilton in the <i>Federalist Papers<\/i>, saw how an increase in the power of government could lead to an increase in the rights held by its people. If you doubt this, look around the world at those societies whose governments are too weak to protect the rights of their peoples from either civil insurgencies or invading states.<\/p><p id=\"idm45643878570512\">Nevertheless, we often assume that, (i) in times of tranquility, our rights are most abundant and the power of government is at its lowest; and (ii) in times of emergency, the balance shifts and the powers of government are increased at the expense of our personal and political rights.<\/p><p id=\"idm45643878571152\">Second, we must subject this habit of thinking to the logical criticism known as Parmenides\u2019 Fallacy.<\/p><p id=\"idm45643878571952\">This fallacy indulges in the frequent, persistent assertion that we should compare the present state of affairs with the past in order to evaluate the policies that have gotten us to where we are now. In fact, we should compare our present situation with alternative outcomes that would have arisen from different policies, had they been chosen. This is true for prospective policies as well: it is a sophist\u2019s argument to deride a proposed policy (say, social security reform or free trade) by simply saying that we will be worse off after the policy is implemented than we are now. That may well be true. But it could be true of even the wisest policy if other alternatives, including doing nothing, would make us even worse off in the future.<\/p><p id=\"idm45643878572704\">Let me give a famous example of Parmenides\u2019 Fallacy at work. The turning point in the United States\u2019 1980 presidential race came when Ronald Reagan criticized President Jimmy Carter\u2019s record during a debate by asking the American people \u201cAre you better off today than you were four years ago?\u201d Though rhetorically devastating, this question is hardly the way to evaluate a presidency. After all, the condition of the nation will never stay the same for four years, regardless of who is in office. A more relevant question would have been, \u201cAre you better off now than you would have been if Gerald Ford had remained the president and had to cope with rising oil prices, the Iranian Revolution, the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and soaring interest rates?\u201d In the same way, we should reframe fallacious prospective questions such as \u201cWill we be better off in five years than we are now if we adopt a certain policy?\u201d The better question to ask is \u201cWill we be better off in five years by adopting this policy than we will be <i>in five years<\/i> if we do not?\u201d<\/p><p id=\"idm45643878622032\">To take another example, during the first year of the Clinton presidency, the administration proposed a healthcare reform measure to Congress. A USA Today\/CNN\/Gallup poll conducted shortly after the president\u2019s speech to a joint session of Congress found that 57% of Americans approved the plan. Six months later, after a highly successful advertising campaign by the insurance industry, approval had dropped some 20 points and the measure was dead in Congress. The heart of this campaign was a series of television ads featuring a middle-class couple, Harry and Louise, discussing the proposed legislation. It would, they concluded, result in diminished coverage for themselves and higher prices. Only the bureaucrats in Washington could possibly endorse such idiocy. As a result, the reform plan was crushed. Who would support a program that made its recipients worse off? And two decades later, we know that \u2014 without reform \u2014 coverage diminished and prices rose even more steeply than the claims of Harry and Louise.<\/p><p id=\"idm45643878646560\">Third, we can apply the concept of Parmenides\u2019 Fallacy to the problem of the tradeoffs between humane values and personal rights, and the defeat of terror.<\/p><p id=\"idm45643878667584\">We begin at Time<sub>1<\/sub> \u2014 the current state of affairs that has, shall we say, a civil liberties value (CLV) of 10 and a national security value (NSV) of say 10. A policy is proposed \u2014 for example, the collection of intelligence metadata by machines \u2014 that will yield values of say 9 with respect to CLV and NSV of say 11 at Time<sub>2<\/sub>, say one year later. It is very tempting to say that the balance has been redrawn (it has) and, therefore, that our civil liberties and the humane values they protect are worse off because of the adoption of the new policy (which is not necessarily true). Note that the real comparison is not whether we are \u201cworse off than we were before,\u201d a true but trivial statement because we know from Parmenides\u2019 Fallacy that Time<sub>1<\/sub> is not an indefinitely enduring option. Rather, the real question which will determine whether we are worse off at Time<sub>2<\/sub> is whether we would have been better off at Time<sub>2<\/sub> had the NSV not increased. (Parmenides, a pre-Socratic philosopher held that all change was illusion; it is his \u201cfallacy\u201d because of the mistaken attempt to assess a situation by measuring it against the past, which cannot be infinitely perpetuated, as opposed to comparing the new situation against other possible present states of affairs; it is equally a mistake to compare a proposed future world against the present world \u2014 which will necessarily be subject to change \u2014 instead of against other possible future worlds.)<\/p><p id=\"idm45643878599168\">Now there are many difficulties in applying this analysis: (1) How do we know what things would\u2019ve been like in worlds that were never realized; perhaps increasing state power has failed to make us safer (e.g., the assumption that torture never works obviates any utility of torture in any conceivable future world). (2) Some critics have suggested that this kind of analysis can retrospectively justify any course of action \u2014 no matter how badly things turn out \u2014 because there is always a counterfactual hypothesis that suggests they could be worse.<\/p><p id=\"idm45643878605232\">These criticisms remind me of the arguments made by the Critical Legal Studies movement back in the 1980s, which asserted that law was indeterminate because one can always make a legal argument for any position. Such a claim could only be made by someone who has never tried to persuade a judge, and the claim that a counterfactual hypothesis can justify any course of action is the sort of rhetoric that could only be employed by someone who has never had to make responsible decisions or persuade anyone.<\/p><p id=\"idm45643878614560\">In fact, difficult though it may be, such assessments are always the case with estimative intelligence. Because we can never know the future, we can never know the possible futures that did not come into being. Decision-making requires guesses about just such alternative futures and guesses that may be more or less wise but are never a matter of technological certainty.<\/p><p id=\"idm45643878619728\">Still, we go on: how many editorials and speeches have been made asking whether we were better off now than we were before and who\u2019s to blame if we were not. Reflective people know this is fallacious but to correct for it just seems too difficult. It reminds me of the familiar story of a man who comes out of a bar and finds another man, obviously drunk, on all fours looking for something beneath the streetlamp. The first man says, \u201cAre you all right? Can I help you?\u201d The second man replies, \u201cI\u2019ve lost my keys.\u201d The first man asks, \u201cWhere did you last see them?\u201d The second man replies, \u201cOver there, by my car.\u201d The first man says, \u201cThen why are you looking here?\u201d The second man says, \u201cBecause the light\u2019s better here.\u201d<\/p><p id=\"idm45643878629664\">There we remain. Similar to those Regency balls, where an outer circle of men and an inner circle of women danced with minimal contact, the \u201cnothing should change\u201d crowd (who take every proposed policy as the herald of a police state and the death of the Constitution) are in a slow cotillion with the \u201cwe must compromise our values to survive\u201d crowd who exaggerate every threat. They are dancing toward the delegitimation of democratic parliamentary government. Where will we be when the music stops?<\/p><\/div><div id=\"article-back\" class=\"back\"><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm45643878633088\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Declaration of interest<\/h3><p id=\"idm45643878645056\">Professor Bobbitt declares that he has no conflict of interest.<\/p><\/div><h3 class=\"main-title\">Funding sources<\/h3><p>None.<\/p><\/div>\n",

This leads to elevated thermal stresses in rotors and casings of the turbines. Hence, temperature distributions of the components have to be predicted with highest accuracy at various load points in the design process to assure reliable operation and long life time. This paper describes the windage heating effect in full labyrinth seals used in steam turbines. An analytical approach is presented, based on CFD simulations, to predict the resulting steam temperatures. A broad application range from very low to highest Reynolds numbers representing different turbine operation conditions from partial to full load is addressed. The effect of varying Reynolds number on the flow friction behaviour is captured by using an analogy to the flow over a flat plate. Additionally, the impact of different labyrinth geometries on the friction coefficient is evaluated with the help of more than 100 CFD simulations. A meta-model is derived from the numerical results. Finally, the analytical windage heating model is validated against measurements. The presented approach is a fast and reliable method to find the best performing labyrinth geometries with lowest windage effects, <i>i.e.<\/i> lowest steam temperatures.<\/p><\/div>\n",

The aim is to reduce the green house gas output as much as possible to reduce environmental impacts. This aim can be achieved by optimizing the blades and flow paths, reducing leakages between stationary and rotating components, using improved seals or by increasing the main steam conditions like pressure and temperature. Since turbine components such as casings or rotors are highly stressed <i>e.g.<\/i> by thermal gradients in the materials, the temperatures in each load case have to be known as accurately as possible. The more precisely the stress distribution is known in the design process, the more exact the components life time can be predicted.<\/p><p id=\"idm140189813119200\">A contra directional effect can occur in labyrinth seals optimization: windage heating occurs due to rotor rotation. Windage heating leads to a temperature increase of the steam that flows through the labyrinth. The smaller the radial clearance of the seal, the lower the mass flow through it is, which can result in large temperature increases. The effect is strong in case where the labyrinth is long with many fins, <i>e.g.<\/i> in labyrinth seals on a thrust balance piston. If the design goal is to minimize leakage mass flow by use of such types of seals in combination with higher inlet temperatures, then the effect of windage heating may become an important design consideration.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm140189813141024\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Current state of research<\/h3><p id=\"idm140189813144752\">The first law of thermodynamics describes the effect of rotor rotation on total enthalpy increase \u2206<i>h<\/i><sub>t<\/sub>:<\/p><div class=\"disp-formula\"><a id=\"E1\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><math display=\"block\"><mrow><mtext>\u00a0<\/mtext><mi>\u0394<\/mi><msub><mi>h<\/mi><mtext>t<\/mtext><\/msub><mo>=<\/mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>M<\/mi><mtext>\u200a<\/mtext><mi>\u03c9<\/mi><\/mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>m<\/mi><mo>\u02d9<\/mo><\/mover><\/mfrac><\/mrow><\/math><div>(1)<\/div><\/div><p id=\"idm140189813091136\">Due to rotor rotation with the frequency <i>\u03c9<\/i>, a torque <i>M<\/i> acts onto the steam mass flow <span class=\"inline-formula\"><math display=\"block\"><mover accent=\"true\"><mtext>m<\/mtext><mo>\u02d9<\/mo><\/mover><\/math><\/span> through the labyrinth.

The friction coefficients at rotor and stator are expressed by equations, which depend on a local circumferential Reynolds number.<\/p><p id=\"idm140189813169216\"><a href=\"#fn08\" id=\"xref08\">Millward and Edwards (1994)<\/a> give an empirically determined relationship for the circumferential friction coefficient to be used for calculation of the rotor torque. In addition to the geometry the friction coefficient also depends on the mass flow and circumferential Reynolds number.<\/p><p id=\"idm140189813176944\">Also, equations are available in the literature which model the temperature increase in a rotating labyrinth by approximating it to a single rotating shaft and discs. Sources for information are the publications of <a href=\"#fn04\" id=\"xref04\">H\u00fctte (1955)<\/a>, <a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"xref10\">Polkowski (1984)<\/a> and <a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"xref12\">Stoff (1988)<\/a>.<\/p><p id=\"idm140189813069920\"><a href=\"#fn02\" id=\"xref02\">Denecke et al. (2005)<\/a> summarize parameters, which influence the windage heating effect and the leakage in a labyrinth seal. They carried out an analytical and a numerical study on short stepped labyrinths to find out that <i>e.g.<\/i> pressure ratio, geometry, axial Reynolds number, circumferential Mach number and fluid parameters mostly influence the windage and leakage behavior.<\/p><p id=\"idm140189813702944\"><a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"xref13\">Yan et al. (2009)<\/a> analyze the influence of honeycomb structures, applied to the stator, on windage heating behavior numerically. The labyrinth investigated is again a stepped labyrinth with four fins. They point out that the windage heating effect increases with the pressure ratio. It is observed further that the gap width between stator and the fins influences the temperature in such a way that it becomes high in case the gap width is low. Finally the numerical calculations are validated against measurements.<\/p><p id=\"idm140189813083200\">In a further study <a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"xref14\">Yan et al. (2010)<\/a> simulated the flow in a stepped labyrinth seal using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with and without honeycombs applied to the casing wall. They varied pressure ratio, pre-swirl in front of the labyrinth and the honeycomb design. The result shows that the pre-swirl has a weak influence on the leakage flow, while the windage heating is influenced strongly by it. Another result is that the honeycomb design influences leakage.<\/p><p id=\"idm140189813146240\"><a href=\"#fn09\" id=\"xref09\">Nayak and Dutta (2015)<\/a> analyze the influence of grooves in the casing of a see-through-labyrinth due to rotor stator contact. The aim of this study is to explore the windage heating effect numerically and experimentally. The authors analysed honeycombs applied to the casing. The results are compared to results from the McGreen and Ko model. One result is that it is possible to increase the leakage by up to three times in case of no honeycombs with wear grooves and a small radial clearance. In the case of small radial clearances, the contact grooves result in lower windage heating in labyrinths with honeycomb applied.<\/p><p id=\"idm140189813063600\"><a href=\"#fn03\" id=\"xref03\">He et al. (2012)<\/a> calculate the windage heating in a stepped labyrinth with three fins and diabatic wall conditions with CFD. In addition, thermal models of the rotor and the stator are included in the simulations. They also focussed on a labyrinth with honeycomb structures applied to the casing. One major outcome is that pre-swirl strongly influences windage heating, which is more pronounced in case of smooth walls. It is also observed that the pressure ratio influences windage heating.<\/p><p id=\"idm140189813083696\">The literature review shows that many authors analyze very short and stepped labyrinths numerically as well as experimentally. Further, many authors state that the pressure ratio, pre-swirl, circumferential Reynolds number and the state of the fluid are the important parameters, which most influence windage heating. To the authors knowledge no models are available which capture the influence of all these parameters for different types of labyrinth seal geometries.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm140189813088112\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Windage heating correlations<\/h3><p id=\"idm140189813094080\">The present paper describes an analytical method for predicting the windage heating effect in long labyrinth seals, by using friction and contraction coefficients calculated with CFD:<\/p><p id=\"idm140189813099456\">It is assumed that the circumferential flow velocity in a single chamber <i>c<\/i><sub>u<\/sub> does not change in axial direction <i>z<\/i>:<\/p><div class=\"disp-formula\"><a id=\"E4\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><math display=\"block\"><mrow><mstyle scriptminsize=\"10pt\"><mfrac><mrow><mtext>d<\/mtext><msub><mi>c<\/mi><mtext>u<\/mtext><\/msub><\/mrow><mrow><mtext>dz<\/mtext><\/mrow><\/mfrac><mo>=<\/mo><mn>0<\/mn><\/mstyle><\/mrow><\/math><div>(4)<\/div><\/div><p id=\"idm140189813131712\">In each chamber of the labyrinth the average circumferential flow velocity is approx. 50% of the rotor surface velocity:<\/p><div class=\"disp-formula\"><a id=\"E5\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><math display=\"block\"><mrow><msub><mi>c<\/mi><mtext>u<\/mtext><\/msub><mo>=<\/mo><mstyle scriptlevel=\"+1\"><mfrac><mn>1<\/mn><mn>2<\/mn><\/mfrac><\/mstyle><mi>U<\/mi><mo>=<\/mo><mstyle scriptlevel=\"+1\"><mfrac><mn>1<\/mn><mn>2<\/mn><\/mfrac><\/mstyle><mtext>\u200a<\/mtext><mi>\u03c9<\/mi><mtext>\u200a<\/mtext><mi>r<\/mi><\/mrow><\/math><div>(5)<\/div><\/div><p id=\"idm140189813138656\">This relationship is exact for laminar Couette flow and sufficiently exact for describing fully turbulent Couette flow (<a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"xref12\">Stoff, 1988<\/a>).<\/p><p id=\"idm140189813070944\">Since the axial velocity component influences the windage heating effect (<a href=\"#fn08\" id=\"xref08\">Millward and Edwards, 1994<\/a>;

So various labyrinth geometries can be investigated with the aim to parameterize the windage coefficient <i>C<\/i>(Geom) and the contraction coefficient <i>\u03b1<\/i>(Geom). The chamber can be described geometrically by the radial clearances <i>s<\/i><sub>1<\/sub> and <i>s<\/i><sub>2<\/sub>, the axial distances between the fins <i>T<\/i><sub>1<\/sub> and <i>T<\/i><sub>2<\/sub> as well as the fin thickness <i>t<\/i>. <i>t<\/i> is set to a constant value for this investigation.

The mesh generator meshes each model afterwards. The CFD solution process using Ansys CFX is carried out after mesh generation. The final result is reached in less than 1,000 iteration steps for each labyrinth with use of a proper start solution. The main convergence criterion beside maximum residuals being lower than 5\u00b710<sup>\u20134<\/sup> is a negligible variation of local pressure, temperature and velocity at single monitor points in the domain from step to step of the solver run.<\/p><p id=\"idm140189813233552\">The characteristic output parameters of the flow field are calculated automatically, which are then stored together with the geometry parameter describing the calculated labyrinth.

This is in agreement with <a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"xref13\">Yan et al. (2009)<\/a>. The reason for this behaviour is that the square of the flow velocity influences the wall shear. This effect is compensated to a certain degree since the flow angle <i>\u03b2<\/i> is increasing with elevated pressure ratio, leading to a reduction of <i>\u03c4<\/i><sub>u<\/sub>. Additionally, the friction coefficient <i>c<\/i><sub>f<\/sub> reduces with increasing absolute Reynolds number, since the exponent <i>B<\/i> is negative.<\/p><p id=\"idm140189813319728\">The windage heating strongly increases with higher rotor speed as expected (right diagram in <a href=\"#F3\">Figure 3<\/a>). At a given pressure ratio, the flow angle <i>\u03b2<\/i> decreases with increasing rotor speed; leading to a flow vector pointing increasingly towards the circumferential direction. Additionally, the absolute flow velocity increases, leading to higher circumferential shear force.<\/p><p id=\"idm140189813317424\">The symbols shown in <a href=\"#F3\">Figure 3<\/a> show the CFD results of one labyrinth configuration at different thermodynamic boundary conditions.

The largest difference is at low Reynolds numbers (low rotor speed and\/or small pressure ratio). The reason for this is the strong gradient of the function <i>c<\/i><sub>f<\/sub>(Re) at low Reynolds numbers. Since the function <i>c<\/i><sub>f<\/sub>(Re) becomes nearly constant at very high Reynolds numbers, the accuracy increases if high Reynolds number flow exists.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm140189813312688\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Extension to arbitrary geometries<\/h3><p id=\"idm140189813311872\">The hybrid meta model delivers the model coefficients <i>C<\/i>(Geom) and <i>\u03b1<\/i>(Geom) as explained above.

For typical steam turbine applications, \u2206<i>T<\/i> is in a range of approximately 5 to 30\u00a0K depending on labyrinth geometry and steam conditions.<\/p><p id=\"idm140189813618160\">The comparison between computed and measured temperature increase \u2206<i>T<\/i> is given for different load cases (<i>i.e.<\/i>, Reynolds numbers) in the seals of three turbines of nearly similar type (<a href=\"#F6\">Figure 6<\/a>).<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F6\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/development\/3604238d-33a4-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/est_recusandae_consequuntur_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/development\/3604238d-33a4-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/est_recusandae_consequuntur_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/development\/3604238d-33a4-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JGPPS-00018-2017-01_F0006.tif\" download=\"JGPPS-00018-2017-01_F0006.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 6 - Comparison between computed and measured values of \u2206T in three turbines.<\/p><\/div><\/div><p id=\"idm140189813615680\">The presented model calculates the temperature increase \u2206<i>T<\/i> in the whole turbine load spectrum with a deviation of less than 2K compared to CFD.

For a specific speed <i>n<\/i><sub>0<\/sub> and a pressure ratio <i>\u03c0<\/i><sub>0<\/sub> (<a href=\"#F7\">Figure 7a<\/a>) the windage heating effect leads to a predicted temperature profile (solid line) with a nearly constant value compared to the theoretical dropping isenthalpic throttling temperature (dashed line). The experimental values (squares), which have been corrected due to minor insulation losses in the test stand, are in very good agreement to the predictions. Deviations originate from uncertainties in the determination of the insulation losses and reduced pre swirl in front of the labyrinth seal.<\/p><p id=\"idm140189813596944\">At increased pressure ratio (<a href=\"#F7\">Figure 7b<\/a>), the rising mass flow leads to a stronger steam cooling capability (see <a href=\"#E14\">Equation 14<\/a>). In contrast, the elevated pressure level corresponds to a stronger windage heating effect (a larger total enthalpy increase \u2206<i>h<\/i><sub>t<\/sub>), which in turn leads to a similar plot compared to <a href=\"#F7\">Figure 7a<\/a>.<\/p><p id=\"idm140189813592272\">At a rotor speed reduction to 0.7 <i>n<\/i><sub>0<\/sub> (<a href=\"#F7\">Figure 7c<\/a>), the windage power is roughly half the windage power at full rotor speed (compare <a href=\"#F3\">Figure 3<\/a>) and the predicted curve gets closer to the isenthalpic throttling temperature profile.

This model accounts for the influence of varying axial and circumferential flow velocities in the labyrinth seal chambers over a wide range of Reynolds numbers. The impact of labyrinth geometry on the windage heating effect is also taken into account. This is accomplished with the help of a meta model. Since this kind of method is used to compute the geometry dependent windage coefficient, the approach can be extended to labyrinth topologies, which differ from the presented, by additional meta model training.<\/p><p id=\"idm140189813417440\">The comparison with experimental data from steam power plant turbines and a labyrinth seal test stand shows that the model can accurately predict the temperatures in the labyrinth seal at various load points and for different labyrinth chamber geometries.<\/p><p id=\"idm140189813416720\">The approach presented is a reliable method to calculate the windage heating effect in labyrinth seals. It is suitable to be used in an optimization procedure (<i>e.g.<\/i> genetic algorithm) to find the best performing labyrinth seal geometries with lowest steam temperature. The algebraic model helps turbine manufacturer to design cost effective turbines with highest efficiency and reliability in a fast and efficient manner.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a

The actual surface roughness achieved in the housing hardware depends on the manufacturing process. Improving the volute surface quality will in most cases be more expensive. The potential benefits in turbine efficiency therefore have to be balanced with the additional costs. In the present article, the aerodynamic effects due to changes of volute surface roughness are assessed. Pressure loss measurements in simple pipes are conducted in order to calibrate a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) sand grain roughness model against measured roughness values. Two test cases involving flow simulations of the complete turbine stage are presented in order to validate the calibrated model and to show that Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) CFD simulations are generally able to predict the effects of surface roughness on the turbine performance. The results of the test cases show a significant reduction in turbine efficiency with increased volute roughness levels. As expected, the sensitivity of efficiency due to changes in surface roughness of the volute is largest in areas of high near-wall velocity, <i>i.e.<\/i>, at the volute exducer and in the small volute cross-sections close to the tongue.<\/p><\/div>\n",

The surface quality of the casting mainly depends on the quality of the sand core and the coating. Compared with other turbine components such as wheels and vanes, the resulting surface roughness of the housing is many times higher. Nevertheless, it is unclear how the turbine performance is affected by volute surface roughness in general and what roughness level is necessary in order to achieve the best turbine efficiency at acceptable costs. BorgWarner\u2019s continuous effort to improve turbine performance therefore involves the volute surface quality. In order to ensure that current targets for power and emissions are met, extensive studies are conducted, the findings of which facilitate the precise development of the manufacturing processes required.<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F1\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/42466e22-af0a-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/non_ea_placeat_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/42466e22-af0a-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/non_ea_placeat_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/42466e22-af0a-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JGPPS-00032-2017-01_F0001.tif\" download=\"JGPPS-00032-2017-01_F0001.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 1 - (a) Steel casting turbine housing for automotive turbocharger and (b) CAD model of mono-scroll volute.<\/p><\/div><\/div><p id=\"idm46309697489744\">The main challenge in assessing roughness effects in small turbocharger turbines by means of hot gas stand (HGS) testing is to ensure high geometric accuracy of the housing volutes. Only then is it possible to attribute the measured differences in efficiency to differences in surface roughness. CFD simulations are a valuable tool to complement the experimental results, as the geometry can be controlled very accurately in the simulation model.<\/p><p id=\"idm46309697496864\">In order to account for surface roughness effects in CFD simulations, one requires a rule for the conversion of measured roughness values into sand grain roughness. This conversion has been described in several publications, especially for large gas and steam turbines. In his review paper, <a href=\"#fn03\" id=\"xref03\">Bons (2010)<\/a> quotes values between k\/R<sub>a<\/sub> = 2 and k\/R<sub>a<\/sub> = 10. <a href=\"#fn01\" id=\"xref01\">Adams et al. (2012)<\/a> present conversion rules for sand grain roughness from three measured roughness parameters (<i>e.g.<\/i>, k\/R<sub>a<\/sub> = 5.9), which are tested with flow experiments using water as the flow medium.<\/p><p id=\"idm46309697577088\">The Moody diagram (<a href=\"#fn07\" id=\"xref07\">Moody, 1944<\/a>) is widely used in order to estimate the friction coefficient in pipe flows from Reynolds number and a relative roughness. The diagram is based on pipe flow experiments using sand paper on the walls, the average diameter of the sand grains serving as the relative roughness. <a href=\"#fn06\" id=\"xref06\">McGovern (2011)<\/a> revised the experiments and the author points out that the Moody diagram was merely intended for simple estimations, as it contains quite a few simplifications. Apart from the basic studies described above, hardly any results have been published regarding surface roughness values and flow regimes of interest for turbocharger applications. The simulation results from  <a href=\"#fn04\" id=\"xref04\">Javed and Kamphues (2014)<\/a> show that surface roughness can have a marked effect on the flow in compressor stages with radial impellers. Nevertheless, the effect on the stage efficiency seems to be relatively small, as the differences due to roughness changes  presented in their paper are well below 1%. To the knowledge of the author, there is currently no publication available dealing specifically with the effects of surface roughness on the aerodynamic performance of turbines for automotive turbochargers.<\/p><p id=\"idm46309697474416\">The present study is set out to answer the following questions:<\/p><div class=\"list\"><a id=\"idm46309697480224\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><ol><li><p id=\"idm46309697414912\">Can the effects of surface roughness on turbine performance be reliably predicted by modified RANS CFD simulations?<\/p><\/li><li><p id=\"idm46309697426688\">What effect does the volute surface roughness have on the volute and rotor flow?<\/p><\/li><li><p id=\"idm46309697428528\">Is stage efficiency more sensitive to roughness changes in specific parts of the volute?<\/p><\/li><li><p id=\"idm46309697430128\">What is the potential penalty in case of increased volute surface roughness and which mono-scroll applications are most sensitive to changes in roughness levels?<\/p><\/li><\/ol><\/div><p id=\"idm46309697451856\">The work is based on the measurement of pressure loss over a simple pipe in order to determine the effects of surface roughness on the flow in a geometrically well-defined experiment. The sand grain roughness coefficient for the CFD simulation is calibrated against the results of the pipe measurements. This CFD roughness model is validated by comparison of turbine stage CFD results with HGS results. The origin of the additional loss and the changes to the flow field due to changes in surface roughness are examined in detail. Further CFD studies are conducted using the calibrated roughness model in order to assess the effects of surface roughness in mono-scroll volutes on the steady-state turbine performance.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46309697453472\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Surface roughness measurements<\/h3><p id=\"idm46309697457024\">Stylus roughness measurements conforming to EN ISO 4288 are unfeasible in most turbine housings due to geometric constraints. It is virtually impossible to find a region in the volute that facilitates a measurement over a straight line long enough to comply with the norm specifications. Even if this is possible, no measurement of local roughness around the circumference is possible, the result will only be an average along a line. Local measurements are desirable as they enable the characterization of significant aerodynamic effects of surface roughness in the volute.<\/p><p id=\"idm46309697457856\">In order to ensure reliable roughness measurements in all possible turbine housing geometries and to enable local measurements of surface roughness, an optical measurement method is used in the present study. Contactless topographical measurements at ten circumferential positions around the volute are obtained by means of a confocal scanning microscope (Zeiss Axio CSM 700). The measured topography is shape-filtered using a second-order polynomial in order to obtain the surface\u2019s height profile (see example in <a href=\"#F2\">Figure 2<\/a>).<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F2\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/42466e22-af0a-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/aperiam_ipsum_unde_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/42466e22-af0a-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/aperiam_ipsum_unde_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/42466e22-af0a-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JGPPS-00032-2017-01_F0002.tif\" download=\"JGPPS-00032-2017-01_F0002.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 2 - Volute overview and example of height profile resulting from surface roughness measurement.<\/p><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46309697464224\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Model calibration \u2014 Pipe measurements<\/h3><p id=\"idm46309697468784\">The relationship between technical roughness values and the sand grain roughness to be used in the flow simulations is derived from pressure loss measurements over straight pipes. These are cast varying several parameters, such as cast material, sand grain size of the core and casting velocity, in order to obtain surfaces of different roughness levels. The roughness of the inner pipe surface is measured using the optical method described in the preceding section. These roughness values are then matched to the pressure loss over the respective pipe.<\/p><p id=\"idm46309697469584\">The pressure loss measurements are conducted at Reynolds numbers between 20,000 and 200,000 in a test rig featuring a smooth inlet pipe of 3\u00a0m length, so that fully developed turbulent boundary layers are achieved. The air is sucked through the measurement section (length 400\u00a0mm, diameter 50\u00a0mm) from a low-pressure chamber downstream. Pressure transducers are used upstream and downstream of the measurement section with three pressure tappings around the circumference.<\/p><p id=\"idm46309697472160\">The Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model of the rig serves as the basis of the CFD calibration, resulting in a correlation between the CFD roughness coefficient and the measured surface roughness. Relatively large uncertainties arise due to the roughness distribution on the pipe surfaces and due to the relatively short measurement length, leading to small pressure loss. It is therefore felt that the validity of the calibration is still questionable. Hence, two suitable turbine test cases are examined in the present study for further validation. They include roughness measurements, computed tomography (CT) scans of the turbine housings and HGS results. These test cases increase the confidence in the calibration so that it can be applied to turbine flow simulations in order to assess the effects of volute roughness on the flow field.<\/p><p id=\"idm46309697474784\">Throughout this paper, the correlation derived from the pipe measurements is used for the calculation of the technical roughness equivalent to the sand grain roughness used in the simulations. Roughness values are presented relative to a reference S<sub>a,ref<\/sub> (see <a href=\"#E1\">Equation 1<\/a>) which is deemed representative of current volute surfaces in steel casting turbine housings from series production.<\/p><div class=\"disp-formula\"><a id=\"E1\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><math display=\"block\"><mrow><msub><mi>S<\/mi><mrow><mi>a<\/mi><mo>,<\/mo><mi>r<\/mi><mi>e<\/mi><mi>l<\/mi><\/mrow><\/msub><mo>=<\/mo><msub><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>S<\/mi><mi>a<\/mi><\/msub><\/mrow><mo>\/<\/mo><mi>S<\/mi><\/mrow><\/mrow><mrow><mi>a<\/mi><mo>,<\/mo><mi>r<\/mi><mi>e<\/mi><mi>f<\/mi><\/mrow><\/msub><\/mrow><\/math><div>(1)<\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46309697431184\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Computational setup<\/h3><p id=\"idm46309697446048\">All the simulation results in the present paper are obtained from steady-state RANS CFD simulations, using the commercial package Ansys\u00ae CFX (2015), Release 16.2. The turbine stages\u2019 nominal geometry serves as the input for the simulation setups. For the volute domain and the exit domain downstream of the turbine wheels, Ansys\u00ae Meshing is used to generate tetrahedral\/prism grids. The rotor domain features a structured hexahedral grid, generated in Turbogrid (see <a href=\"#F3\">Figure 3<\/a>). Grid point numbers are 800,000 in the volute, 2,500,000 in the rotor domain and 700,000 in the exit domain. These values are based on the results of a sensitivity study with variations of the grid density in each of the three domains. The number of grid points is selected so that the stage efficiency varies by less than 0.1% between the selected and the next finer mesh. The grid quality criteria are kept in the following ranges: orthogonality angle &gt;20, expansion factor &lt;20 and aspect ratio &lt;80.<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F3\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/42466e22-af0a-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/optio_sapiente_fugit_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/42466e22-af0a-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/optio_sapiente_fugit_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/42466e22-af0a-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JGPPS-00032-2017-01_F0003.tif\" download=\"JGPPS-00032-2017-01_F0003.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 3 - Computational grids, (a) volute and (b) rotor.<\/p><\/div><\/div><p id=\"idm46309697448256\">The shear-stress transport turbulence model is used and stationary parts of the computational domain are connected to rotating parts by \u201cfrozen rotor\u201d interfaces.

The additional loss in the boundary layers is accounted for by adapting the shear stresses (Ansys Theory Guide). <a href=\"#fn05\" id=\"xref05\">Joo et al. (2016)<\/a> present a detailed large eddy simulation study of flow separation due to surface roughness in diffusing flows. The authors conclude that a modified RANS model cannot predict the roughness-induced effects on flow separation. However, the boundary layers at the volute surfaces of the present turbine test cases are largely attached, except for the transition region to the waste gate channel. The adapted RANS CFD model should therefore be able to predict the additional loss due to increased roughness fairly well.<\/p><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46309697477360\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h3 class=\"main-title\">Model validation<\/h3><p id=\"idm46309697483328\">Both test cases presented in this section feature vaneless mono-scroll volutes and radial inflow turbine wheels.

Six turbine housings of different volute roughness levels are tested both on the HGS and using the calibrated CFD model.

The respective roughness level is indicated by the color intensity, going from light (low roughness) to dark (high roughness). The CFD results (blue triangles) show barely any effect of surface roughness on flow capacity, whereas the HGS data (red squares) does show some variation in flow capacity.

The flow conditions at the rotor inlet might be significantly different for increasing roughness levels, as the volute boundary layers thicken and become more skewed. This could entail consequences for the turbine wheel design.<\/p><p id=\"idm46309697454496\">In <a href=\"#F9\">Figure 9<\/a>, the loss production in the main turbine components of test case 1 is presented as generation of specific entropy.

In <a href=\"#F11\">Figure 11b<\/a>, the loss is shown to increase especially in the hub and tip regions downstream of the rotor. The secondary kinetic energy in the vortex regions raises due to the thicker boundary layers at the rotor inlet (see <a href=\"#F11\">Figure 11c<\/a>). Overall, there are only fairly small effects on the rotor exit flow field due to volute surface roughness, despite small but considerable alterations to the flow field at the rotor inlet.

Most of the other sectors lead to similar loss increases as the even roughness change (blue line) does.

This effect can be explained by the much higher level of near-wall Mach number in sector 4, visible in the contours of <a href=\"#F15\">Figure 15<\/a>. These contours also show increasing near-wall Mach number towards the volute exducer, which points to the possibility that the efficiency might be sensitive to roughness changes in the exducer area as well. In order to test this hypothesis, the surface roughness is varied between 0.5 S<sub>a,ref<\/sub> and 1.4 S<sub>a,ref<\/sub> on narrow strips on both sides of the exducer (green marks in <a href=\"#F16\">Figure 16a<\/a>). This region accounts for only about 5% of the volute surface. Nevertheless, increased surface roughness in this area can have a relatively large effect on efficiency, as shown by the comparison with an even roughness increase (blue line) in <a href=\"#F16\">Figure 16b<\/a>. <a href=\"#F17\">Figure 17<\/a> shows that, compared with the even roughness increase, the loss generation in the rotor almost remains the same, while the major loss increase occurs in the volute. The effect on stage efficiency can therefore be attributed to raised total pressure loss on the volute surfaces with high near-wall Mach number.<\/p><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F15\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/42466e22-af0a-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/eveniet_nemo_voluptas_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/42466e22-af0a-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/eveniet_nemo_voluptas_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/42466e22-af0a-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JGPPS-00032-2017-01_F0015.tif\" download=\"JGPPS-00032-2017-01_F0015.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 15 - Near-wall Mach number at volute surfaces from CFD results (test case 1, PR = 2.1).<\/p><\/div><\/div><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F16\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/42466e22-af0a-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/occaecati_exercitationem_omnis_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/42466e22-af0a-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/occaecati_exercitationem_omnis_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/42466e22-af0a-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JGPPS-00032-2017-01_F0016.tif\" download=\"JGPPS-00032-2017-01_F0016.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 16 - Roughness variation at volute exducer, (a) faces with varying roughness in CFD setup and (b) change in turbine efficiency (CFD).<\/p><\/div><\/div><div class=\"container-fluid img-container\"><div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F17\"\/><div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/42466e22-af0a-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/vero_maxime_odio_400.png\"\/><\/div><div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/42466e22-af0a-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/vero_maxime_odio_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/42466e22-af0a-11e7-b3ad-0242ac110002\/JGPPS-00032-2017-01_F0017.tif\" download=\"JGPPS-00032-2017-01_F0017.tif\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div><\/div><div class=\"row\"><p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 17 - Change in loss generation for roughness increase at volute exducer (CFD).<\/p><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"section\"><a id=\"idm46309697865712\"><!-- named anchor --><\/a><h4 class=\"section-title\">Turbine wheel type and volute size<\/h4><p id=\"idm46309697864944\">Several different turbine wheel types of different sizes, combined with volutes of different sizes, are examined using the calibrated CFD model described above.

Only small effects on the flow capacity are observed for changes in volute surface roughness.<\/p><\/li><li><p id=\"idm46309697960128\">The rotor inlet conditions are affected moderately by the changes in volute surface roughness.

In turn, the effect on the rotor loss can become significant when the roughness distribution around the circumference varies. It is therefore not sufficient to only account for the additional total pressure loss in the volute when assessing the effect of surface roughness on the stage efficiency.<\/p><\/li><li><p id=\"idm46309697957648\">The turbine efficiency is sensitive to changes in the surface roughness in regions with high near-wall Mach number (<i>i.e.<\/i>, small cross-sections and volute exducer).<\/p><\/li><li><p id=\"idm46309697956144\">The sensitivity of efficiency to changes of the volute surface roughness reduces with increasing degree of reaction of the turbine stage.<\/p><\/li><\/ol><\/div><p id=\"idm46309697955376\">More turbine test cases are necessary in order to further increase confidence in the calibrated CFD model und examine its

However, in spite of the West\u2019s significant investment in the region\u2019s economies and attempts to enter the local markets through both bilateral and multilateral channels, this shift never materialised. In fact, since the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), Uzbekistan\u2019s trade cooperation with Russia has remained robust, and only in 2014 did China overtook Russia as Uzbekistan\u2019s biggest trading partner. This article aims to understand why Russia and China have become Uzbekistan\u2019s biggest economic partners, especially in the energy sector. To understand this, I believe that it is important to analyse the nature of both domestic and international factors and their interaction. First of all, there are international factors: globalisation, the rise of China and an increase in global demand for natural resources; the role of the China-initiated the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Silk Road Economic Belt; and Russia\u2019s attempt to reclaim its \u201cgreat power\u201d status since 2000 and Putin\u2019s attempt to build and expand the Eurasian Economic Union. Second, there are domestic factors: understanding Russia\u2019s and China\u2019s foreign trade policy linked not only with economic growth but also with the structure of foreign economic policy decision-making, or \u201cpower vertical,\u201d among other domestic elements. This article will draw on Critical International Political Economy (CIPE) to argue that this tradition is well equipped and offers an important framework to understand foreign economic policy of powers such as Russia and China. The CIPE does not simply combine the domestic and international factors but also insists on their indivisibility and engages with cultural, ideological and social elements in their historical contingency.<\/p><\/div>\n",

Every human action is inevitably conditioned by what surrounds him and by his own body\u2019 \u2014 Leo Tolstoy,\n            <i>War and Peace<\/i><\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"section\">\n        <a id=\"idm140128710225376\">\n            <!-- named anchor -->\n        <\/a>\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Introduction<\/h3>\n        <p id=\"idm140128710236720\">After the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, Uzbekistan emerged as an independent state, ending more than a century of the Russian and Soviet rule. At that time, many predicted that the country would adopt the capitalist path of economic development\n            for its post-Soviet transition and foster relations with the West. This expectation was given further impetus by both domestic and foreign policy actions of the government of Uzbekistan, e.g., switching from the Cyrillic alphabet (which was\n            introduced under Joseph Stalin in 1940) to the Latin script (1992), ending the Rouble as the legal tender in the country (1993), officially taking the Russian TV channels off air (1994) and becoming a member of GUAM (Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan\n            and Moldova, an organisation supported by the United States as a way of countering the Russian influence in the area) in 1999. Moreover, the government outlined the Uzbek foreign policy strategy as a political and economic shift towards the\n            West, in particular the United States, the European Union (EU) and Japan.<sup id=\"xref1\"><a href=\"#fn1\">1<\/a><\/sup> This Western-oriented approach was characterised as the government\u2019s highest foreign policy priority, which aimed to attract\n            the Western capital, investment and businesses and establish a strategic (long-term) partnership with them to achieve economic development.<\/p>\n        <p id=\"idm140128710256848\">However, in spite of the above and the West\u2019s own significant investment in Uzbekistan\u2019s national economy and its attempt to enter the Uzbek market, through both bilateral and multilateral channels, this shift has never materialised. In fact,\n            as shown in <a href=\"#T1\"><span class=\"generated\">Table 1<\/span><\/a> , Uzbekistan\u2019s trade cooperation with Russia has remained strong. Moreover, in 2014, China overtook Russia as Uzbekistan\u2019s biggest trading partner, with total trade of more\n            than US$ 3 billion.<\/p>\n        <div class=\"container-fluid

cooperation is the energy sector, because Central Asia as a whole is a region of largely untapped natural mineral resources. These resources have become increasingly desirable as world supplies are depleting,\n            and political instability in the Middle East has lead the developed world to look for other sources. This has meant that Central Asia has become one of the last areas of continued competition among the world\u2019s major economic powers. Moreover,\n            as the study will demonstrate, this competition for energy is linked with Russia\u2019s and China\u2019s broad trade relations with Uzbekistan.<\/p>\n        <p id=\"idm140128710188400\">This article will try to explore the underlying factors in China\u2019s and Russia\u2019s energy partnership in Uzbekistan. What are the main determinants, international and domestic, of their foreign economic policy in Central Asia? This article will argue\n            that strategies of foreign economic policy of states such as Russia and China grow out of the interaction of international and domestic forces. What this article proposes is to use Critical IPE. This tradition does not simply combine the insights\n            of the schools of thought like Domestic or Comparative Political Economy (CPE; focuses on domestic economic policy choices of states) and International Relations (focuses on strategic interest of \u201cGreat Powers\u201d). It also rejects the \u201chigh\u201d\n            and \u201clow\u201d politics dichotomy on which they are based and instead insists on the indivisibility of the domestic and international factors and also the economic and the political factors. It is \u201cpluralist\u201d in its approach and has wide-ranging\n            analytical tools in international political economy. For the purpose of this case study, we need to engage with the thematic debates, namely the role of the state and the concept of globalisation.<\/p>\n        <p id=\"idm140128710720496\">By analysing the role of the state in IPE, this article aims to find an answer to the fundamental question about powers such as China and Russia and the structure of their foreign economic policy decision-making. The concept of globalisation provides\n            the structural context. Although globalisation is not primarily concerned with state sovereignty, it helps to understand the changing distribution of economic power, the rise of China and increased demand of energy. These contemporary themes\n            on globalisation are very timely and important to understand the underpinnings of Russia\u2019s and China\u2019s economic cooperation with Uzbekistan.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"section\">\n        <a id=\"idm140128710189920\">\n            <!-- named anchor -->\n        <\/a>\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Critical IPE to understand Russia\u2019s and China\u2019s energy cooperation with Uzbekistan?<\/h3>\n        <p id=\"idm140128710167280\">I argue that this case is best understood via the Critical school approach. It is based on multiple origins \u2014 including classical political economy, radical theories of development and CPE \u2014 which has meant that the kinds of questions and debates\n            are necessarily more varied. This school has been established in opposition to the mainstream, American school of IPE, rejecting the idea that all issues can be reduced to the methods of rational choice.<sup id=\"xref2\"><a href=\"#fn2\">2<\/a><\/sup>            Although varied, a key aspect of the Critical school is that it concentrates instead on how the agent of state is itself shaped by the social and historical structures of the economic environment in which it is situated. The economic behaviour\n            of individual actors is, thus, not understood as a purely rational response to external circumstances in which they themselves do nothing to condition how economic agents think about the choices available to them. Rather, behaviour is assumed\n            to reflect social aspirations, which arise as a consequence of socially constituted identities, and the process of identity formation responds to complex dynamics of accumulation to embedded economic norms.<\/p>\n        <p id=\"idm140128710211808\">The Critical IPE is \u201cpluralist\u201d in its approaches and has wide-ranging analytical tools in international political economy as means of breaking down the analytical barriers between the domestic and international factors but also between politics\n            and economics. These features stand in sharp contrast to the way that IPE has developed in the United States, where positivism and empiricism rule.<\/p>\n        <p id=\"idm140128710223776\">This article suggests that to understand China\u2019s and Russia\u2019s economic policy in Uzbekistan, we need to look into the thematic debates, namely the concept of state and globalisation. The combination of these conceptual tools will help us frame\n            this article.<\/p>\n        <div class=\"section\">\n            <a id=\"idm140128710258512\">\n                <!-- named anchor -->\n            <\/a>\n            <h4 class=\"section-title\">The state in CIPE<\/h4>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710158416\">My argument is that analysing the role of the state in Critical IPE is crucial because it will help us to look for answers to the fundamental question about the states like China, Russia and Uzbekistan. It offers a broader understanding of\n                the role of the state, i.e. conceptualising it through economic, political, social and ideological complexities of the contemporary globalised world. At the same time, unlike the mainstream American tradition of IPE (where state debates\n                tend to be associated with the study of only advanced Western industrialised democracies), Critical IPE in its analysis is more sensitive towards non-Western or peripheral states.<sup id=\"xref3\"><a href=\"#fn3\">3<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710170352\">The arguments of many scholars within the tradition of Critical IPE are grounded on the core contention that state and society or agent and structure are in essence mutually constitutive and, therefore, require an appropriate analytical engagement.\n                Scholars like Robert Cox, Philip Cerny, Andrew Gamble, David Marsh and Anthony Payne argue that the state needs to be located socially and disaggregated institutionally.<sup id=\"xref4\"><a href=\"#fn4\">4<\/a><\/sup> They also accept that the\n                interests and policy networks and communities through which the state and other actors pursue their interest are likely to be transnational, as well as national.<\/p>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710172624\">Overall, they agree that states exist as a structure both in a national and in a \u201cglobal,\u201d systemic context and as agents within the world. For the purpose of this article, this Critical tradition of IPE provides a good starting point to study\n                foreign trade policy of the Great Powers in Central Asia because, as pointed earlier, strategies of foreign economic policy of the Great Powers like Russia and China grow out of the interaction of international and domestic forces. The\n                historical development of domestic and international structures of the Great Powers provides important characterisation or assumption to understand their contemporary foreign economic policy. In this light, these factors are found to mutually\n                influence one another. The next section will consider another important debate in Critical IPE, namely the concept of globalisation, which I argue offers an important structural context for this article. It also provides an important link\n                to our aforementioned arguments about the state.<\/p>\n        <\/div>\n        <div class=\"section\">\n            <a id=\"idm140128710193504\">\n                <!-- named anchor -->\n            <\/a>\n            <h4 class=\"section-title\">Globalisation and its impact on global energy demand<\/h4>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710195072\">The notion of globalisation has been widely used in social science. Scholars within CIPE characterise this as \u201ca powerful transformative force that is responsible for profound changes in societies, economies and institutions of governance\n                and world order.\u201d<sup id=\"xref5\"><a href=\"#fn5\">5<\/a><\/sup> The article argued that in the Critical tradition, the state exists as a structure, both in a national and in a global, systemic context, and as agents within the world. The notion\n                of state has been understood as being reorganised, restructured and reengineered in relation to the contemporary global change.<sup id=\"xref6\"><a href=\"#fn6\">6<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710202784\">One of the thematic debates associated with globalisation is its impact on global energy supplies. This discussion will help us to present a structural context for the empirical part of this article. Moreover, this contemporary theme on globalisation\n                is very timely and important to understand what the resurgent powers like China and Russia are doing in Central Asia.<\/p>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710206032\">The issues of energy, particularly with a rise in demand for energy and energy security in the contemporary world, have taken one of the central positions among the debates on economic globalisation. This debate in itself offers several arguments\n                and issues: the global players in the energy market, global power\u2019s struggles for the world\u2019s energy resources, the role and position of resource-rich states in the globalised world, multilateralism versus bilateralism in energy diplomacy,\n                and so on.<\/p>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710212336\">Many authors argue that globalisation and the rise of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (commonly referred to as BRICS) have increased the demands for energy resources.<sup id=\"xref7\"><a href=\"#fn7\">7<\/a><\/sup> It has brought expansion\n                of demand not only through international trade but also through cross-border investments, deregulation of domestic markets and industrial restructuring that links the older energy industries to the new global political economy. They believe\n                that this transformation of energy industries and markets is apparent around the world. They claim that the biggest danger was growing demand for energy in Asia, followed by concerns about possible conflict in the Middle East and constraints\n                in nuclear power.<\/p>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710215712\">As shown in <a href=\"#F1\">Figure 1<\/a>, demand for energy in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries barely grows, whereas in China and in other fast-growing economies, energy consumption increases drastically.\n                According to the British Petroleum (BP) Energy Outlook, by 2035, China will become the biggest energy importer in the world.<sup id=\"xref8\"><a href=\"#fn8\">8<\/a><\/sup> The ratio of China\u2019s dependence on foreign energy imports will grow\n                from 15% in 2014 to 23% in 2035.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"container-fluid img-container\">\n                <div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F1\" \/>\n                    <div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/735b1d2f-6b10-11e6-9e6c-0242ac110003\/dolores_ut_libero_400.png\" \/><\/div>\n                    <div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/735b1d2f-6b10-11e6-9e6c-0242ac110003\/dolores_ut_libero_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/735b1d2f-6b10-11e6-9e6c-0242ac110003\/CJES-00009-2016-02_F0001.jpg\" download=\"CJES-00009-2016-02_F0001.jpg\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div>\n                <\/div>\n                <div class=\"row\">\n                    <p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 1 - Energy consumption by region.<\/p>\n                    <div class=\"fig-description\"><i>Reproduced from BP, Outlook to 2035 \u2014 energy use to rise by a third, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bp.com\/en\/global\/corporate\/energy-economics\/energy-outlook-2035\/energy-outlook-to-2035.html\" id=\"idm140128710525008\">http:\/\/www.bp.com\/en\/global\/corporate\/energy-economics\/energy-outlook-2035\/energy-outlook-to-2035.html<\/a>, with permission from BP.<\/i><\/div>\n                <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710224304\">Overall, according to the above projections, while the demand for energy resources will grow in Japan, Europe and North America, it will soar in the developing countries such as China, Brazil and India. According to the aforementioned sources,\n                globalisation and the rise of BRICs has already created imbalance between supply and demand of energy resources such oil and gas. For instance, as per the BP data in 2014 alone, natural gas consumption per capita has increased in the countries\n                like China, Russia and the United States. The United States recorded the largest growth in consumption among the OECD countries (+2.9 growth), while China (+8.6%) and Russia remained the world\u2019s largest consumers of natural gas.<sup id=\"xref9\"><a href=\"#fn9\">9<\/a><\/sup>                China\u2019s dependence on foreign oil will grow from 59% in 2014 to 76% in 2035, while its dependence on gas will grow from just under 30% in 2014 to 42% in 2035.<sup id=\"xref10\"><a href=\"#fn10\">10<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710227360\">By and large, globalisation and the rise of the BRICs have made energy security more important. According to the above characterisation about the state, the significant growth in energy demand caused by globalisation and the rise of the BRICs\n                will have enormous impacts on global energy demands. This process will also make a big impact on the foreign policy of the Great Powers. It will force them to reorganise their foreign economic policy, work on the diversification of their\n                oil and gas suppliers and find alternative sources of energy. As shown in <a href=\"#F2\">Figure 2<\/a>, since 2007, gas consumption in China has overtaken production. This can be seen as one of the important factors that underpin China\u2019s\n                energy policy in Uzbekistan.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"container-fluid img-container\">\n                <div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F2\" \/>\n                    <div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/735b1d2f-6b10-11e6-9e6c-0242ac110003\/consequatur_ratione_quia_400.png\" \/><\/div>\n                    <div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/735b1d2f-6b10-11e6-9e6c-0242ac110003\/consequatur_ratione_quia_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/735b1d2f-6b10-11e6-9e6c-0242ac110003\/CJES-00009-2016-02_F0002.jpg\" download=\"CJES-00009-2016-02_F0002.jpg\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div>\n                <\/div>\n                <div class=\"row\">\n                    <p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 2 - China\u2019s growth in natural gas production and consumption (billion cubic metres).<\/p>\n                    <div class=\"fig-description\"><i>Based on data from BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2016, available at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bp.com\/statisticalreview\" id=\"idm140128710521088\">www.bp.com\/statisticalreview<\/a>.<\/i><\/div>\n                <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"section\">\n        <a id=\"idm140128710236288\">\n            <!-- named anchor -->\n        <\/a>\n        <h3 class=\"main-title\">Globalisation and China\u2019s economic policy in Uzbekistan<\/h3>\n        <p id=\"idm140128710238048\">China has a long history of its relationship with Central Asia. This has traditionally represented political, economic and cultural relationship. John Fairbank labels this cooperation as \u201ca relationship of peace, war, trade, deception and marriages,\n            all the ingredients for a good story.\u201d<sup id=\"xref11\"><a href=\"#fn11\">11<\/a><\/sup> The only period that China has been kept away from Central Asia was during the Russian occupation and the Soviet era in the last 100 years. During the Soviet\n            era, trade between the socialist republics of Central Asia and China was virtually blocked. In spite of some tentative agreements between the Central Asian republics and Xinjiang, China\u2019s autonomous region, in the beginning of the 1960s and\n            the 1980s, there was not a single regular-functioning trading route between them.<sup id=\"xref12\"><a href=\"#fn12\">12<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n        <p id=\"idm140128710252272\">The collapse of the Soviet Union offered China a great chance to re-establish its historical ties with Central Asia. Since the early 1990s, China established diplomatic relation with Uzbekistan. In October 1992, China opened its embassy in Tashkent.\n            The same year, both countries created Economic and Trade Agreement, a Most Favoured Nation Treatment. In the 1990s, the state leaders of both countries held regular high-level meetings. For instance, the Chinese government invited Karimov\n            to China three times, in 1992, 1994 and 1999, and the Chinese President Jiang Zemin himself visited Uzbekistan in 1996.<sup id=\"xref13\"><a href=\"#fn13\">13<\/a><\/sup> However, due to Uzbekistan\u2019s own foreign policy line, which was centred on\n            \u201cadvanced West\u201d in the 1990s, its historical, political, economic and social ties with Russia and the role of other Great Powers and developed countries in Asia like South Korea, the dynamics of China\u2019s cooperation with Uzbekistan was significantly\n            slow.<\/p>\n        <p id=\"idm140128710253744\">A visible political and economic cooperation with China only commenced in the 2000s. As shown in <a href=\"#T2\"><span class=\"generated\">Table 2<\/span><\/a> , for about a decade, until the early 2000s, the trade cooperation between Uzbekistan and\n            China was significantly small, with the total annual trade volume of less than US$ 100 million. This was about seven times lower than Uzbekistan\u2019s total trade with Russia or with the OECD countries. The beginning of acceleration of bilateral\n            trade cooperation started in 2002 when Uzbekistan\u2019s total import volume from China doubled, from US$ 56 million in 2001 to US$ 115 million in 2002. Drastic increase in Uzbekistan\u2019s export to China commenced in 2004. In 2003, the volume of\n            export was US$ 18 million, and in 2004, this figure jumped to US$ 371 million. Within 10 years, in 2014, China managed to overtake not only the West (or OECD countries) that attempted to establish strong cooperation with Uzbekistan in the\n            1990s, but also Russia, the country Uzbekistan\u2019s economy heavily depended on since the mid-19th century. <a href=\"#T2\"><span class=\"generated\">Table 2<\/span><\/a> and <a href=\"#T3\"><span class=\"generated\">Table

<p id=\"idm140128710194000\">As we have seen earlier, since the formation of this institution, the region\u2019s geoeconomic and geopolitical significance, as well as rise in China\u2019s domestic economy, which increased demand for foreign natural and mineral resources, has arguably\n                played a great role in China\u2019s approach towards Central Asia through this regional organisation. Since the establishment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), China\u2019s trade cooperation with Uzbekistan has greatly increased, and\n                particularly, the energy aspect of cooperation has been at the core of China\u2019s approach towards Uzbekistan and the region. Moreover, in September 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to Central Asia announced his \u201cSilk Road\n                Economic Belt,\u201d a regional economic initiative that aims to establish a network of transportation that links China with Baltic States through Central Asia. During the Summit in Tajikistan in September 2014, economic integration became\n                a significant part of the SCO agenda, especially the promotion of Xi Jinping\u2019s idea of a Silk Road Economic Belt, which we shall discuss below.<\/p>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710196048\">Although one could argue that two main powers in the organisation, China and Russia, are in competition for the resources of the Central Asian region, in the early 2000s, this institution provided a platform for both powers to cooperate on\n                common grounds of interest. One of the areas of such cooperation has been to curb or reduce the West\u2019s, in particular the United States\u2019s, influence and its overall role developed throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, especially after\n                the United States launched its \u201cWar on Terror\u201d in Afghanistan and established military presence in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. By mid-2000s, it was clear that both Russia and China were uncomfortable with the United States\u2019s presence in\n                the region.<\/p>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710195664\">In the 2005, SCO Joint Declaration China objected to the stationing of American troops in Central Asia.<sup id=\"xref14\"><a href=\"#fn14\">14<\/a><\/sup> China and Uzbekistan signed the Treaty on Friendly and Cooperative Partnership during this\n                visit, indicating strengthening of bilateral ties. China also offered economic assistance to Central Asia. The Chinese President Hu Jintao announced that China was going to offer soft loans to the amount of US$ 900 million. By then, the\n                representatives of Chinese Oil and natural gas companies had started frequent visits to the region promising funding to wide range of projects. For instance, in May 2005, the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and Uzbekneftegaz\n                signed deals related to 23 oil fields in Uzbekistan. Based on this agreement, the CNPC decided to invest US$ 600 million.<sup id=\"xref15\"><a href=\"#fn15\">15<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710220128\">In July 2005, Wu Yi, Chinese Deputy Prime Minister, made an official visit to Uzbekistan. The main topic of Wu\u2019s dialogue with his Uzbek counterparts was trade and economic cooperation. During this visit, another Chinese company Sinopec signed\n                an agreement with Uzbekneftegaz to set up a joint venture. Sinopec announced to invest US$ 100 million in oil exploration and development of existing fields in Uzbekistan.<sup id=\"xref16\"><a href=\"#fn16\">16<\/a><\/sup> During the conversation\n                with Wu, Karimov praised bilateral cooperation and called China as a trustworthy friend and an amicable neighbour. Both concluded that the governments would make serious steps to improve economic, political and military ties.<sup id=\"xref17\"><a href=\"#fn17\">17<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n            <p\n                    id=\"idm140128710239200\">As we have seen, energy became one of the core areas of cooperation between the two countries. China\u2019s largest oil and gas producer, the CNPC, opened its office in Tashkent in 2006. The company became involved in exploring and developing oil\n                and gas fields in eastern and western Uzbekistan, including in the area of the Aral Sea, and signed several energy deals with the National Holding Company Uzbekneftegaz.<sup id=\"xref18\"><a href=\"#fn18\">18<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710261616\">Some of the agreements were related to the pipeline construction (the CNPC would guarantee the funding for the cross-border pipeline project in Central Asia) and five oil and gas exploration blocks, which cover a total area of 34,000 km<sup>2<\/sup>,\n                including the area located in Ustyurt, Amudaya and Fergana valley. These are the country\u2019s three largest petroliferous basins.<\/p>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710265664\">In November 2007, Wen Jiabao, the Premier of the State Council of the People\u2019s Republic of China, paid an official visit to Uzbekistan to attend the SCO summit. During this visit, the two countries signed Joint Communiqu\u00e9. Based on this\n                communiqu\u00e9, both parties agreed to increase bilateral ties to a new heights, including high-level visits, and deepen pragmatic cooperation in politics, economy, culture and security.<sup id=\"xref19\"><a href=\"#fn19\">19<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n            <p\n                    id=\"idm140128710246928\">The document also states that Uzbekistan will support China in opposing independence of Taiwan, in any form, including membership in international and regional organisations. In exchange, the document indicates that China will provide\n                its full support to the Uzbek government in domestic policy to maintain stability and economic development and that China also opposes any attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of Uzbekistan under the guise of human rights.\n                <sup\n                        id=\"xref20\"><a href=\"#fn20\">20<\/a><\/sup> In terms of economic cooperation, both sides agreed to further work on strengthening partnership in the spheres like energy, mining and infrastructure, chemical industry, agriculture, telecommunications\n                and transportation and explore new spheres of economic engagement. This also shows that this energy partnership gave impetus to foster broader bilateral trade cooperation.<\/p>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710239008\">In 2008, China became Uzbekistan\u2019s top five trading partner. Since then, China made further investments in the strategic sectors of energy transport and telecommunications. For instance, the second stage of the Gas pipeline project\n                that links Turkmenistan\u2013Uzbekistan\u2013Kazakhstan\u2013China was completed in 2011. In October of the same year, Uzbekistan and China signed an agreement on establishing an Intergovernmental Cooperation Commission.<sup id=\"xref21\"><a href=\"#fn21\">21<\/a><\/sup>                            Since then, Uzbekistan started exporting 10 bcm of gas per year to China. By 2012, China became Uzbekistan\u2019s second-biggest trading partner and its biggest investor. The volume of bilateral trade reached US$ 2.9 billion. This\n                shows almost 50 times increase in the volume of bilateral trade since 2005. In 2012, China\u2019s investment totalled US$ 4 billion in 35 different projects.<sup id=\"xref22\"><a href=\"#fn22\">22<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710243184\">These are among the largest of the agreements with the Central Asian governments concerning oil development. These examples indicate the Chinese determination and genuine interest in oil and gas fields in Central Asia. As a mode\n                of engagement, the Chinese government has been using its traditional methods such investment, trade and security cooperation. As we have seen earlier, China has conducted its cooperation with the states in Central Asia both\n                bilaterally and multilaterally, mainly through the SCO, which involves China, Russia and the countries in Central Asia. From the Chinese perspective, the SCO\u2019s main role has been to reduce Western, mainly the United States\u2019s,\n                influence in the region, which increased after 9\/11.<\/p>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710216480\">The second role Uzbekistan played has been as an important gas transit state. The Turkmen gas carried through the Central Asia\u2013China pipeline (see <a href=\"#F4\">Figure 4<\/a>) passes through both Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. The gas\n                pipeline starts at the city of Gedaim, on the border of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, and reaches Horgos, Xingjinang Uygur Autonomous region of China, from where it is connected to the Second West-East Pipeline. The current\n                length of the pipelines is 1,830 km, with three parallel lines, A, B and C. All of these three lines have an overall annual capacity of carrying more than 55 bcm.<sup id=\"xref23\"><a href=\"#fn23\">23<\/a><\/sup> The construction\n                of the first two lines started in July 2008. The line A was completed in December 2009 and the line B in October 2010. By the end of 2011, both lines delivered 30 bcm of gas to China.<\/p>\n            <div class=\"container-fluid img-container\">\n                <div class=\"row img-table-footer\"><a id=\"F4\" \/>\n                    <div class=\"mfp-hid pull-left\"><img class=\"img-responsive magnific-popup\" src=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/735b1d2f-6b10-11e6-9e6c-0242ac110003\/qui_deleniti_eos_400.png\" \/><\/div>\n                    <div class=\"views-and-downloads pull-left hidden-xs\"><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/735b1d2f-6b10-11e6-9e6c-0242ac110003\/qui_deleniti_eos_900.png\" class=\"mfp-inline magnific-popup\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-eye\"\/><\/span> Enlarge Image\n                    <\/a><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/publication-files\/production\/735b1d2f-6b10-11e6-9e6c-0242ac110003\/CJES-00009-2016-02_F0004.jpg\" download=\"CJES-00009-2016-02_F0004.jpg\"><span><i class=\"fa fa-download\"\/><\/span> Download Image\n                    <\/a><\/div>\n                <\/div>\n                <div class=\"row\">\n                    <p class=\"fig-title img-table-footer\">Figure 4 - Central Asia-China pipeline \u2014 Lines A, B and C.<\/p>\n                    <div class=\"fig-description\"><i>Reproduced with permission from Geopipelitics, available at \u201cChina\u2019s march Westward and the ISIS challenge,\u201d GeoPipelitics <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.geopipelitics.com\/?p=1192\" id=\"idm140128710514320\">http:\/\/www.geopipelitics.com\/?p=1192<\/a>.<\/i><\/div>\n                <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710211392\">The CNPC started the construction of the line C in September 2012. This line has a capacity of 25 bcm. It was completed at the end of 2013 and started its gas exporting operation on 31 May 2014.<sup id=\"xref24\"><a href=\"#fn24\">24<\/a><\/sup>                            According to the CNPC, these three lines of the Central Asia\u2013China gas pipeline will provide 20% of China\u2019s gas consumption.<sup id=\"xref25\"><a href=\"#fn25\">25<\/a><\/sup> This shows the significance of the pipeline to the Chinese\n                economy.<\/p>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710250512\">During Xi\u2019s visit to Central Asia in September 2013, China and the three Central Asian countries, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, signed agreements to add another route, line D of the pipeline. Later, the CNPC signed individual\n                agreements with its counterparts in Tajikistan (with Tajikneftegaz on 4 March 2014) and Uzbekistan (with Uzneftegaz on 9 August 2014) on establishing joint ventures and the construction and operation of the line D sector of\n                the Central Asia\u2013China gas pipeline. This is a 1,000 km pipeline with an annual output of 30 bcm, which aims to deliver gas to China crossing Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. Upon the completion of this fourth line, the\n                Central Asia\u2013China gas pipeline will be Central Asia\u2019s largest gas conveyance system, with an output of 85 bcm per year.<\/p>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710249232\">Apart from oil and gas, China has also invested in Uzbekistan\u2019s other sectors like railways and electricity. China has also been providing assistance in developing Uzbekistan\u2019s civilian nuclear power potential. China\u2019s XD Group\n                is involved in the areas related to modernisation and construction of the Uzbek capital\u2019s electricity supply system, providing equipment worth US$ 26.3 million.<sup id=\"xref26\"><a href=\"#fn26\">26<\/a><\/sup> In April 2012, this\n                company signed an agreement with the National Energy Company of Uzbekistan for engineering, procurement and construction project. In March 2013, the Chinese company Xian Electric and Uzbekenergo, state joint stock company of\n                Uzbekistan, signed a Memorandum of Understanding to construct a wind farm in Uzbekistan.<sup id=\"xref27\"><a href=\"#fn27\">27<\/a><\/sup> Based on this memorandum, the parties agreed to create wind power facilities with the capacity\n                of up to 100 MW, which allows generating 170 million kilowatt of electricity per hour. The total cost of the project is US$ 250 million.<\/p>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710228912\">Other area of economic cooperation that has increased since 2007 is the cotton sector. In April 2007, Uzbek-Chinese Working Group held their first session on cotton trade. In October 2007, the group held the Second International\n                Cotton Fair. More than 100 Chinese companies participated in the fair.<\/p>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710227952\">As we have seen, since the 2005 SCO summit, the leaders of both countries have made frequent visits to each other\u2019s countries. These state visits have been carried out on both bilateral and multilateral occasions and have served\n                not only to reinforce cooperation between the two counties but also to reduce the West and Russia\u2019s influence not only in Uzbekistan but also in the whole region of Central Asia. Based on the speeches of state leaders and signed\n                agreements\/documents, economic, trade, energy and infrastructure development aspects of cooperation have taken central emphases. For instance, in 2011, Wu Bangguo, Chairman of the Standing Committee of China\u2019s National People\u2019s\n                Congress, at that time visited Uzbekistan and made a speech at the Uzbek Parliament, Oliy Majlis (the Supreme Assembly). In his speech, he praised China\u2013Uzbek relations and reiterated China\u2019s eagerness to further increase bilateral\n                cooperation.<sup id=\"xref28\"><a href=\"#fn28\">28<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710198624\">On 6 June 2012, President Karimov, during the SCO summit in Beijing, met with Wen Jianbao, former Chinese Premier, and emphasised that China was Uzbekistan\u2019s trustworthy partner and that Uzbekistan would like to \u201cexpand bilateral\n                cooperation in fields such as economy and trade, energy, railway, finance and technology and cement coordination with China within the SCO.\u201d<sup id=\"xref29\"><a href=\"#fn29\">29<\/a><\/sup> Wen Jianbao declared that in terms of\n                consumption and investment, not only Central Asian but also the whole Eurasian continent has a potential to be one of the most significant areas in the world.<sup id=\"xref30\"><a href=\"#fn30\">30<\/a><\/sup> During the summit,\n                on 6 June 2012, Chinese former President Hu and Uzbekistan\u2019s President Karimov signed the Joint Declaration on the Establishment of Strategic Partnership.

During this visit, he also reiterated significance of broad cooperation between China and Uzbekistan and emphasised\n                that \u201cboth countries had enjoyed increasingly strengthened mutual political trust, seen mutual understanding and support on those major issues concerning their core interests, worked together to carry out various large projects\n                in the fields of economy and trade, energy, and infrastructure, and cooperated well on regional security as well as regional and international issues. Both countries valued their relationship and regarded each other as good\n                partners and sincere brothers.\u201d<sup id=\"xref32\"><a href=\"#fn32\">32<\/a><\/sup><\/p>\n        <\/div>\n        <div class=\"section\">\n            <a id=\"idm140128710241328\">\n                <!-- named anchor -->\n            <\/a>\n            <h4 class=\"section-title\">Xi Jinping, foreign policy decision-making and the Silk Road Economic Belt<\/h4>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710187856\">In November 2012, Xi Jinping became the General Secretary of the Communist Party, the top of the power hierarchy in China. As a result of regrouping of power structure in China, Xi Jinping also became a head of the State Security Committee,\n                which was set up in November 2013. The committee was established to centralise all elements of the security apparatus, to centralise national security decision-making and to effectively manage an increasing number of foreign policy actors\n                due to China\u2019s economic growth.<sup id=\"xref33\"><a href=\"#fn33\">33<\/a><\/sup> The General Secretary is also a head of \u201cLeading Small Groups\u201d (LSGs), which oversees China\u2019s foreign policy decision-making.<sup id=\"xref34\"><a href=\"#fn34\">34<\/a><\/sup>                This makes Xi Jinping as the most powerful and assertive actor in China\u2019s foreign policy actions. This means that unlike in the Western \u201cpluralistic\u201d societies, Xi Jinping\u2019s foreign policy decisions are not challenged by any opposition\n                groups or individuals. This, to an extent, makes Xi\u2019s Central Asia policy be easily implemented with virtually no obstacles.<\/p>\n            <p id=\"idm140128710183520\">From 3 September to 13 September 2013, Xi Jinping visited Central Asia while taking part in the SCO summit. He became China\u2019s third consecutive head of state to show great interest in this region. During this visit, Xi announced China\u2019s new\n                investments in the region and signed several agreements with the regional states. The agreements were mainly in the fields of infrastructure, energy and development projects. Xi Jinping, like his predecessors, stressed that China\u2019s approach\n                towards Central Asia was only economic and does not bear any political dimensions, and China\u2019s bilateral and regional cooperation was not based on any political integration. Moreover, he repeatedly emphasised that China would not interfere\n
